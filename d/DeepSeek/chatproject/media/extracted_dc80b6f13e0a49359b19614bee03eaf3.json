It is a chronic disease that can lead to various complications, \nincluding diabetic retinopathy, a major cause of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy occurs when \n---CHUNK_BREAK---\ndiabetes \ndamages the small blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (Doe, 2023). \nEarly detection of diabetic retinopathy is crucial for effective clinical treatment. Despite the existence of \nseveral feature extraction approaches, classifying retinal images remains a challenging task, even for \ntrained clinicians (García et al., 2024). To improve the detection process and prevent blindness caused by \ndiabetic retinopathy, we propose the utilization of image processing technology. Through the \nimplementation of deep learning techniques, our aim is to train datasets and provide optimal outcomes to \nophthalmologists (Guerbai et al., 2022). Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, consists of \nmultilayer neural networks with various architectures and models designed for image processing and \nclassification tasks (LeCun et al., 2024). CNNs, a type of deep learning model, have demonstrated \nremarkable success in medical applications, including early disease diagnosis within the human body \n(Kim et al., 2023), as well as the detection of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. \nThis paper represents diabetic retinopathy application using models of CNN (VGG16 and \nEfficientNetB0) to detect and classify retinal fundus images from Kaggle datasets.  \nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a literature review. Section 3 explains the \nmethods and techniques used. Section 4 explains the experimental results obtained, and section 6 \nconclusion and future scope. \n \n2 LITTERATURE REVIEW \n \nMany telemedicine systems developed worldwide can detect various retinal diseases. \nSimultaneously, meticulous studies have demonstrated that diabetes is one of the leading causes of ocular \nblindness (Park & Wang, 2023). Most investigations have explored five categories of diabetic retinopathy, \nranging from No DR, Mild DR, Moderate DR, Severe DR, to Proliferative DR, each graded with intricate \n\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n \n3 \n \n \nSouth Florida Journal of Development, Miami, v.5, n.10. p.01-17, 2024. ISSN 2675-5459 \nprecision (Johnson, 2024). Numerous researchers have dedicated themselves to implementing computer-\nbased diagnosis for diabetic retinopathy.  \nOver the past several years, many have crafted predictive models based on both machine and deep \nlearning, which have proven invaluable to ophthalmologists in identifying and classifying diabetic \nretinopathy. Much effort has been focused on improving early diagnosis of the disease and implementing \nmulti-stage DR classification through handcrafted feature extraction (García et al., 2024). \nDeep learning methods are widely used to solve various medical image analysis problems while \navoiding the limitations of conventional ML methods. Unlike ML models, deep learning models can \nautomatically discover high-level features from retinal images without human intervention. Deep learning \nmodels have been developed for lesion detection using patch image classif\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\nication (Guerbai et al., 2015). \nTechniques for optimal parameter selection of one-class SVM have also been explored in related work \nfor medical image classification tasks (Guerbai et al., 2022). Moreover, recent research comparing CNN \nand SVM approaches for image recognition tasks has shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy \n(Guerbai & Saibi, 2024). In this paper, we present our techniques for detecting and improving the \nclassification performance of diabetic retinopathy. \n \n3 III.METHODS OR TECHNIQUES USED \n \n3.1 CLARITY IN DATASET DESCRIPTION \n \nFirst Dataset: \n• The dataset used is the Diabetic Retinopathy 2015 data from Kaggle, consisting of 35,126 retinal \nimages. These images are annotated and classified into five stages of diabetic retinopathy, helping \nin multi-class classification. Each image is resized to 224x224 pixels, making them suitable for \npre-trained deep learning models. \nData Preprocessing Steps: \no Normalization: Each image's pixel values were normalized to a scale between 0 and 1, ensuring \nconsistency across the dataset and allowing the models to converge more efficiently during \ntraining. \no RGB Format: Initially, Gaussian filtering was applied to reduce noise and enhance clarity, but \nafter evaluation, it was determined that working with the original RGB images yielded better \nresults. The RGB format preserves important color information crucial for diagnosing diabetic \nretinopathy since certain pathological changes are best visualized in color. \n\n--- Page 4 ---\n \n4 \n \n \nSouth Florida Journal of Development, Miami, v.5, n.10. p.01-17, 2024. ISSN 2675-5459 \no Train-Validation-Test Split: The dataset was split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% \ntesting sets. This division allows for robust model training and accurate performance evaluation \non unseen data. \nSecond Dataset: \n• The APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset was used for further experimentation. This dataset \ncontains 3,662 Gaussian filtered images, which were pre-processed similarly by resizing to \n224x224 pixels. Gaussian filtering in this dataset helps in feature enhancement by smoothing the \nimages and reducing background noise, aiding in clearer pattern recognition. \nData Preprocessing Steps: \no Gaussian Filtering: Applied to improve the quality of retinal images by smoothing and reducing \nnoise, making it easier for the deep learning models to detect critical features like lesions. \no Folder Organization: The dataset is organized based on the severity of diabetic retinopathy, \naligning with the standard classification of the disease into five stages. \nWHY TWO DATASETS? \nBy utilizing both the Diabetic Retinopathy 2015 dataset (RGB) and the APTOS 2019 dataset \n(Gaussian-filtered), the study aims to assess the robustness of the models under different image formats \nand pre-processing techniques. The RGB dataset retains important visual details, while the Gaussian-\nfiltered dataset helps with feature enhancement by reducing noise. This dual a\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\npproach provides a more \ncomprehensive evaluation of model performance across varied conditions. \nThe results show the number of images detected at each stage of infection and are presented in \nFigure 1. Each subject in the dataset has both left and right eye fields provided and each image is tagged \nwith a subject ID as well as either left or right. The second dataset contains 3,662 images consisting of \nGaussian filtered images containing 5 stages, and each stage is presented in Figure 2. These images are \nresized into 224x224 pixels. The images in this database contain a significant amount of noise due to \nbeing captured using different types of cameras. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop an algorithm \nthat can effectively handle the presence of noise and variations in the images. \nFigure 1 presents the repartition of the first dataset, and figure 2 presents the repartition of the \nsecond dataset. \n \n \n \n\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n \n5 \n \n \nSouth Florida Journal of Development, Miami, v.5, n.10. p.01-17, 2024.

Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop an algorithm that can effectively \nhandle the presence of noise and variations in the images. \n \n3.2 METHODS \n \nCNN is a deep learning model designed for image processing and analyzing visual data; it is used \nfor segmentation, object detection, and classification of images. The neural architecture of CNNs mimics \nthe intricate functioning of the visual cortex in biological organisms. The network includes several layers, \neach layer interweaving with the other to conjure a hierarchical pathway to process input data. The \nconvolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers are the quintessential components of a \nCNN, each layer bearing a unique responsibility to execute the network's intricate operations. Frequently \nemployed convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures comprise AlexNet, VGGNet, Inception V1–\nV4, ResNet, and DenseNet. The CNN model was subjected to end-to-end training on labeled image \ndatasets, whereby the modification of parameters via an error backpropagation algorithm based on the set \n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n6 \n \n \nSouth Florida Journal of Development, Miami, v.5, n.10. p.01-17, 2024. ISSN 2675-5459 \nobjective function resulted in higher accuracy. In our methodology, we employed the VGG16 and \nEfficientNetB0 models. \nVGG16: The Visual Geometry Group has proposed the CNN architecture known as VGG16 by \nA. Zisserman and K. Simonyan in 2014. The VGG16 architecture was successfully applied to the \nImageNet dataset and its structure is depicted in Figure 3, which contains an input layer, a sequence of \nconvolutional and pooling layers, and \n---CHUNK_BREAK---\nan output layer. \n \nFigure 3.  Architecture of VGG16. \n \nSource: Authors. \n \nVGG's input is configured to accept an RGB picture with dimensions of (224,224, VGG's input is \nconfigured to accept an RGB picture with dimensions of (224,224, 3). The average RGB value for all \npictures on the training set is determined, and the image is then fed into the VGG convolution network. It \nis routed through two convolutional layers. Three-by-three filters are utilized. It is followed by a pooling \nlayer that employs maximum pooling with a stride of 2. It then goes through two convolutional layers, \nfollowed by one pooling layer. It subsequently goes through a series of convolutional and pooling layers. \nFollowing a stack of convolutional layers, there are three fully connected (FC) layers accessible in the \nconclusion. The first two thick layers each include 4096 channels. The last dense layer is a softmax layer \nwith 1000 channels that predicts from the ImageNet dataset's 1000 classes. \nVGG16 with fine-tuning: The pre-trained VGG16 model is unfrozen for fine-tuning and taught \nat a slower learning rate. By freezing the prior layers, the pre-learned weights are preserved, while the last \nlayers are trained on the new dataset. By learning more exact characteristics relevant to the present dataset, \nthe pre-trained model can improve its overall performance. The model's final layers are unfrozen and \ntrained at a reduced learning rate. The original pre-trained weights are still present in the model's prior \nfrozen layers. This allows the model to keep the knowledge from the original dataset while fine-tuning \nand enhancing its performance on the current dataset. \n\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n \n7 \n \n \nSouth Florida Journal of Development, Miami, v.5, n.10. p.01-17, 2024. ISSN 2675-5459 \nEfficientNetB0: EfficientNetB0 is a convolutional neural network that has been trained on over \none million images from the ImageNet database. Its architecture is depicted in Figure 4, featuring \ndepthwise separable convolutions to enhance performance while reducing the number of parameters. \n \nFigure 4.  Architecture of EfficientNetB0 \n \nSource: Authors. \n \nEfficientNetB0 with transfer learning: Recently, Transfer learning has been applied effectively \nin a variety of practical applications, including manufacturing, medicine, and baggage screening. This \neliminates the need for a big dataset and shortness the training period, which is necessary when developing \na deep learning system from scratch.  \nWhen created from the ground up. To train the model on our dataset, replace the last classification \nlayer with a new layer that has the same number of classes as the number of classes in our dataset and \nfreeze the weights of all levels except the last classification layer. \nOverall, transfer learning using EfficientNetB0 can assist us in achieving cutting-edge \nperformance on a variety of computer vision tasks while using fewer data and processing resources (Liang \nand L. Zhe\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\nng.,  2020). \n \n4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \n \nThe proposed model's PC hardware environment boasts an i5 7th HQ CPU, 8GB RAM, and a GTX \n1050 TI GPU, all working in harmonious unison. Our implementation of the EfficientNetB0 and VGG16 \nmodels showcases the sheer brilliance of the Python package Keras and the Tensor flow. For \nefficientnetb0, we employed the awe-inspiring ADAM optimizers with a Categorical cross-entropy loss \nfunction, coupled with a batch size of 32 to train our model for 40 unforgettable epochs. As for VGG16, \nwe unleashed a learning rate of 1e-5 and ADAM with a binary cross-entropy loss function, training for a \nmind-bending 109 epochs. We meticulously split our first dataset into training, validation, and testing, \nwith a 70-15-15 ratio respectively. Our second dataset was similarly divided, with a ratio of 80% training, \n10% validation, and 10% testing. To gauge the efficacy of our model, we monitored the losses that \n\n--- Page 8 ---\n \n8 \n \n \nSouth Florida Journal of Development, Miami, v.5, n.10. p.01-17, 2024. ISSN 2675-5459 \noccurred during training and validation. These losses are the inevitable byproduct of the model's valiant \nattempt to predict the unpredictable. \nFine-tune and transfer learning the pre-trained CNN model: We have experimented with two \napproaches on two different datasets. Our initial approach entailed the utilization of the VGG16 pretrained \nmodel, which we then extended by infusing more layers. These layers were comprised of convolutional \nlayers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization, global average pooling, fully connected layers, and \nadded dropout to prevent overfitting. The output layer consisted of two units, each activated by softmax \nto enable binary classification. To fine tune pre-trained model’s performance on our dataset, we \nresuscitated the VGG16 model's last layers by setting them as trainable.  \nFor our second database, we employed the EfficientNetB0 CNN architecture for transfer   learning. \nOur methodology involved utilizing the pre-trained EfficientNet model as a base model, initially trained \non the ImageNet dataset. We then removed the last layer of the base model and introduced a Flatten layer \nand a Dense layer with softmax activation. This enabled us to classify the images into five categories \nrelated to Diabetic Retinopathy. \n \n4.1 CONFUSION MATRIX AND EVALUATION CRITERIA \n \nIn this study, the performance of the VGG16 and EfficientNetB0 models is evaluated using several \nkey metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. These metrics provide a \ncomprehensive overview of the models' abilities to classify diabetic retinopathy (DR) images. \n• Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the models. The VGG16 model achieved an \naccuracy of 95.21%, while the EfficientNetB0 model surpassed it with an accuracy of 97.54%. \n• Precision and recall are crucial in medical applications. Precision indicates the model's ability to \navoid false positives, while recall reflects i\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\nts effectiveness in detecting true positives. Both metrics \nare vital for ensuring that DR is not misdiagnosed or missed. \n• F1-score provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced metric that is \nparticularly useful for class-imbalanced datasets like those in this study. \n• Confusion Matrix offers a breakdown of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false \nnegative predictions across all DR classes. For example, it allows us to observe the specific stages \nof DR where the models excel or falter, guiding potential improvements in model tuning. \nThe models' performances are further validated through the AUC-ROC curve, which assesses \ntheir ability to distinguish between classes. EfficientNetB0's higher AUC demonstrates its superior ability \nto differentiate DR stages. \n\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n9 \n \n \nSouth Florida Journal of Development, Miami, v.5, n.10. p.01-17, 2024.

For instance, Pour et al. \n(2021) utilized EfficientNet f\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\nor DR detection on the MESSIDOR dataset, achieving AUCs ranging from \n0.93 to 0.945, similar to the AUC of EfficientNetB0 in this study of Das, D. Et  al (2023), This reinforces \nthe efficacy of the EfficientNet architecture in medical image classification tasks, particularly with limited \ndata. \nSimilarly, Wang et al. (2023) introduced a residual attention mechanism combined with \nEfficientNetB5 for DR detection, achieving 98.36% accuracy on a 2-class classification problem. This \ndemonstrates the adaptability of EfficientNet across various configurations, further validating its \nrobustness. \nIn contrast, older architectures such as VGG16, while still highly effective, are being gradually \noutperformed by newer models like EfficientNet due to the latter’s superior ability to handle complex \nimage features with fewer parameters. Studies like Shah et al.

Its success can be attributed to its deep architecture, which extracts \nmeaningful features even in noisy and complex datasets, as seen with the RGB images in this research.  \n \nTable 1.

The ability to diagnose the disease directly from \nfundus images, sans clinical intervention, can boost healthcare efficiency and accessibility significantly. \nIn this study, we delved into the application of pre-trained CNN models, EfficientNetB0 and VGG16 \nutilizing transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques on a relatively small dataset comprising 5 cla\n---CHUNK_BREAK---\nsses \nand 35,126 retinal fundus images. Based on the findings, the fine-tuning of pre-trained CNN models by \nreplacing higher-level layers yielded superior accuracy, surpassing solely replacing the last fully \nconnected layer. EfficientNetB0 showcased slightly better accuracy than VGG16, and its computational \nefficiency makes it suitable for deployment on embedded systems. \nThis project's success highlights AI's potential to aid healthcare professionals in the early detection \nof diabetic retinopathy. With further advancements in AI technology, automated embedded devices that \nuse EfficientNetB0 as the underlying pre-trained CNN model for diabetic retinopathy detection are \npossible. Such devices can enhance the accuracy and speed of diagnoses and expand access to healthcare \nservices, especially in resource-constrained environments. \nThe future scope of this project encompasses several promising avenues. Firstly, expanding the \ndataset to include a more diverse range of fundus images can potentially improve the models' performance. \nAdditionally, investigating the use of other pre-trained CNN models or exploring novel architectures \nspecifically designed for retinal image analysis could yield further advancements in accuracy and \nefficiency. \n \n \n \n\n--- Page 16 ---\n \n16 \n \n \nSouth Florida Journal of Development, Miami, v.5, n.10. p.01-17, 2024.
