  "Regulatory Report on Audit Timeliness and Backdated Reporting Practices (1).docx": "Regulatory Report on Audit Timeliness and Backdated Reporting Practices: \nAnalysis of 2024 DVC Submissions\nIntroduction\n\nWith the objective of ensuring timeliness, accountability, and professional discipline in the audit practices of Chartered Accountants, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) undertook a review of audit reports submitted during the year 2024. This review was based on the DVC Analysis Data provided by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB).\nThe primary purpose of the review was to identify instances of backdated audits, classify them according to the extent of delay, and establish an acceptable threshold for delay in audit report submission. Additionally, the review aimed to uncover behavioral patterns among auditors and audit firms engaging in such practices, thereby laying the groundwork for appropriate regulatory responses and institutional standard-setting.\nBackground\n\nTimely submission of audit reports is a fundamental pillar of professional auditing standards and essential to maintaining confidence in financial disclosures. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), as the regulator of audit quality and professional conduct in Bangladesh, continuously monitors compliance with these standards to uphold the integrity and reliability of financial reporting.\nIn recent years, concerns have been raised regarding the prevalence of backdated audit reports; audits signed after the reporting period has ended but with dates backdated to an earlier time. Such practices undermine the reliability of the audit process, contravene professional ethics, and impede effective regulatory oversight.\nIn 2024, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) provided the FRC with Digital Verification Code (DVC) data, which captures audit submission details including dates of report signing and submission. This data enabled a comprehensive review of audit timeliness, focusing specifically on the identification and analysis of backdated audits.\nThe present analysis serves as a foundation for the FRC to define acceptable thresholds for audit report delays, understand the patterns of such practices across firms and individual auditors, and develop targeted regulatory interventions to strengthen audit discipline in Bangladesh.\nFindings\nTable-1\nThe sample size of this review consists of 690 auditors who have registers for enlistment in the financial year 2024-2025. Table 2 shows the breakdown of the acceptable backdated audit days among the sample reviewed. We found 182 auditors had no backdated audits. A total of 181 auditors were marked as N/A, indicating missing or unclassified data. Additionally, 30 auditors had one instance of a backdated audit, while 138 auditors experienced audit delays of 1-14 days, falling under Category 1&2 (As per Annex A). \nA review was conducted on the highest number of backdated audit days attributable to each individual auditor during the 2024 reporting period. The purpose of this exercise was to assess the degree of audit delay prevalent at the individual level and to determine whether such delays represent isolated incidents or recurring behavioral patterns across the profession.\nThe auditors were categorized based on their maximum reported delay. The distribution is as follows:\nTable-2\nA total of 159 auditors were included in this assessment. Among them, 112 auditors, comprising 71 percent of the total sample, had at least one audit engagement that was submitted more than seven days after the stipulated reporting date. In contrast, only 47 auditors, or 29 percent, remained within a backdated threshold of seven days or less. (Categorized details are in Annex A).\nThis pattern is indicative of a systemic issue. The concentration of delays in the \"more than 7 days\" category strongly suggests that a significant proportion of practitioners either do not adhere to prescribed timelines or operate in an environment where such delays are institutionally tolerated. The matter warrants immediate attention and policy intervention.\nEstablishing an acceptable delay threshold and enforcing reporting discipline is imperative if the profession is to retain its credibility. Left unaddressed, this trend undermines both the reliability of financial statements and the accountability of those entrusted with their verification.\nFRC Suggestions\nIn light of the above findings, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) makes the following recommendations aimed at addressing systemic delays in audit report finalization and restoring time discipline across the profession:\n1. Establishment of a Regulatory Threshold\nA formal regulatory threshold for permissible audit delay should be introduced. Based on the distribution observed, a maximum of seven calendar days from the reporting date may be provisionally considered acceptable. Any audit report issued beyond this threshold shall be flagged as backdated and subject to review.\n2. Mandatory Justification for Delayed Submissions\nFor audit reports submitted beyond the acceptable threshold, the concerned statutory auditor shall be required to submit a written explanation, along with supporting documentation, to the Council or the relevant professional body. Repeated failure to submit reasonable justification shall constitute professional misconduct.\n3. Suspension from FRC Enlistment for 2025 \nAuditors who have one or more audit engagements delayed by more than seven days during the 2024 reporting year shall not be considered eligible for FRC Enlistment for the calendar year 2025. This sanction is intended to reinforce the Council’s zero-tolerance position on audit irregularities and to protect public interest.\nConclusion\nThe prevalence of backdated audit reporting, as evidenced in the 2024 DVC dataset, reflects a departure from expected professional standards and undermines the credibility of the financial reporting ecosystem. The findings confirm that such practices are not isolated but systemic in nature. To restore discipline, ensure accountability, and safeguard public interest, decisive regulatory action is both necessary and overdue. The FRC remains committed to enforcing audit quality through transparent criteria, proportionate sanctions, and institutional cooperation."
