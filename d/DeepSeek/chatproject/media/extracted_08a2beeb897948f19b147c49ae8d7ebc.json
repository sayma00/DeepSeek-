This reports studies \nthe effect of board diversity o n the DSE listed companies’ performance in Pharmaceuticals & \nChemicals Industry and Food & Allied Industry in Bangladesh. Mainly 4 board characteristics (Gender \nDiversity, Board Independence, National Diversity and Government Director Inclusion) and 5 cont rol \nvariables (Total Asset Turnover Ratio, Natural Logarithm of Asset, Firm Age, Sponsor Ownership and \nBoard Attendance) were selected to analyze their impact on the firms' financial performance metrics \nof ROE, ROA, and NAV. The study utilized secondary da ta from annual reports of 54 sample \ncompanies from 2011 to 2021 and applied statistical tools to identify the relationship between the \nvariables. Fixed Effect Model and Feasible Generalized Least Squared Model were appropriate for the \nanalysis in depth.  The results indicate that board diversity can positively impact the financial \nperformance of the selected companies, but not every mechanism has a significant impact. The analysis \ndiscloses that female, independent and foreign directors brings negative impac t on ROA and ROE but \nnone of them are significant for ROE; only proportion of independent directors have significant \nnegative impact on ROA. The impact of foreign directors is still insignificant negative for NAV but \nfemale directors and independent direct ors bring progress in NAV where percentage of only female \ndirectors is significant. Inclusion of government directors brings insignificant positive impact on ROA \nand significant negative impact on ROE and significant positive changes for NAV. The value of total \nassets always brings positive impact on the financial metrics and significantly for ROE and NAV. Also, \nsponsor ownership brings significant changes for ROA and NAV. Surprisingly, board attendance is \nsignificantly impactful for the betterment of all t he three financial metrics. So, only bringing diversity \non board will not be enough for the mentioned industries in the context of Bangladesh. Based on the \nestimated results, it was found that board diversity does not always have a positive impact on firm \nperformance. While some aspects of diversity may have a significant effect, for the Pharmaceuticals \n& Chemicals Industry and Food & Allied Indu stry in Bangladesh, diversity has more weakening  effect \non firm performance, resulting in decreased returns. However, a higher attendance rate of board \nmembers at meetings is found to have a positive impact on firm performance, resulting in higher returns \nfor the firms. The board of directors  have to be experienced, knowledgeable and attentive to the board \nmeetings as well for better performance.  \n \nKeywords: Board diversity, board of directors, corporate governance, firm performance, ROA, ROE, \nNAV, pharmace utical industry, food industry, fixed effect model, FGLS model.  \n  \nvii \n  \nTable of Contents  \nExecutive

perspectives represented among \nthe members of a board of directors. This includes diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, age, \neducation, professional background, and other characteristics.  The importance of board diversity is \nwidely recognized as i t brings a range of benefits, such as promoting innovation and creativity, \nimproving decision -making, enhancing corporate reputation, and better reflecting the diversity of \ncustomers, employees, and other stakeholders. Additionally, board diversity has bee n linked to better \nfinancial performance, as companies with diverse boards have been shown to outperfo rm those with \nhomogenous boards (Marinova  et al.). It should be  noted that board diversity goes beyond simply \nhaving a diverse group of individuals on the  board. To fully realize the benefits of diversity, it is \nessential that all board members are given an equal opportunity to participate and contribute, and that \nthe board culture is inclusive and welcoming to all members, regardless of their background.  When \nthere is no diversity on a board of directors, it can lead to a number of negative consequences. Such as \nlack of perspective, group -thinking, limited skills and talents etc. A homogenous board may lack the \ndiverse perspectives and experiences needed to  make well -informed decisions that reflect the needs \nand interests of a variety of stakeholders, including customers, employees, and shareholders. Boards \nwith no variety may be more prone to groupthink, a phenomenon in which group members prioritize \nconfor mity and consensus over critical thinking and independent decision -making. Also, when boards \nare not diverse, they may miss out on qualified candidates who would bring valuable skills, \nexperiences, and perspectives to the table. This can limit the talent p ool from which boards can recruit, \npotentially resulting in a less effective board. In today's increasingly diverse and socially conscious \nworld, companies that lack diversity on their boards may be seen as out of touch or insensitive. This \ncan lead to neg ative publicity and reputational risks.  \nNumerous published  research es have shown that b oard diversity has become an imperative issue in \ncorporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainable business practices. Companies that are \ncommitted to promoting dive rsity and inclusion in their governance structures may be perceived as \nmore socially responsible and ethical, which can enhance their reputation and brand image.  For \nexample, a diverse board may bring a comprehensive range of perspectives, skills ets, under standings \nand experiences to the decision -making process, which can lead to better outcomes.  Board diversity \ncan also have social benefits, such as promoting social mobility and reducing inequality. By promoting \ndiversity on their boards, companies can hel p to address social issues and contribute to the overall \nsecurity and comfort of society , which will eventually help them boost up their profitability in \noperations . This report  will investigate whether these benefits hold true in the context of \nPharmaceut ical & Chemical and Food & Allied industry  in Bangladesh.  This study will contribute to \nthe understanding of how board diversity can be used to enhance corporate governance in Bangladesh.  \nThis report aims to look for the validity  of the diverse board on co mpany  performance within the \nmentioned  industries in Bangladesh.  The discoveries from  this report  will have input  to the expanding \nbody of previous studies . Moreover, the report will offer guidance and suggestions  for companies that \nare expecting  to enhance board diversity and, consequently, their performance.  \n13 \n Board diversity is an important aspect when it comes to improve firm performance. The variation on \nboard helps to brings many new dimension to decision -making, skill development and overall better \nfirm performance. There are multiple  ways to measure firm performance, including financial metrics \nsuch as profitability, return on asset, return on equity, net asset value, revenue, market share etc. These  \ndescribes  how well a firm is using its res ources to generate profits  and create value for stakeholders . \nPharmaceutical & Chemical industry and Food & Allied industry in Bangladesh have  been growing  \nrapidly in recent years and are highly competitive, and firms within the industries are under consta nt \npressure to increase their performance and profitability.  The diversity of board members, has gained \nincreased attention globally, as it is believed to be linked with improved  performance and value \ncreation. In Bangladesh, there is a growing interest in  board diversity and its impact on company  \nperformance, with some evidence suggesting that diverse boards can lead to upgraded  commercial \nperformance, improved decision -making, and enhanced corporate social responsibility.  However, there \nis a limited amoun t of research on board diversity and firm returns and net asset values  in the context \nof pharmaceutical and food industry in Bangladesh. This research gap highlights the need for a study \nto examine the connection between diversity in board of directors and firm perfo rmance in these \nspecific industries  in Bangladesh.   \n1.1 Scope and  Objective s  \nThe scope of board diversity and its impact on firm performance is immense , with numerous factors \ncontributing to the correlation  between the two. Board diversity can encompass a wide range of \ncharacteristics, including gender, independence , professional experience, and nationality. The impact \nof board diversity on firm s’ performance can also be measured in a variety of ways, including financial \nand non -financial performanc e indicators . The aim of board diversity is to bring together individuals \nwith diverse perspectives and expertise to better inform decision -making and ultimately improve the \nperformance of t he company. This report will observe the scope of the ex tent of diversity in board \nmember selection and benefits of having diversity or demerits of non -diverse board and vice versa.  \nThe objective of this report  is to investigate the correlation  between diversity in board and firm s’ \nperformance in the Pharmaceutical s & Chemical s and Food & Allied industry in Bangladesh. The \nfollowings are main objectives  which this report covers : \ni. To provide  the theoretical developments related to boardroom diversity, corporate governance \nand company’s owners and managem ent and shed light on  previous researches , articles and \nother studies by several authors . \nii. To design the overall research to come to conclusion of the findings.  \niii. To conduct empirical analysis on the effect of board diversity  in Bangladesh .  \niv. To provide findin gs of the empirical research  and suggestions for the companies . \nv. To summarize the detailed analysis and provide conclusion of the  report . \nBy achieving these objectives, the report  aims to contribute to the growing body o f literature on board \ndiversity and f irm performance, particularly in the context of the Pharmaceutical s & Chemical s and \nFood & Allied industry  in Bangladesh.  \n14 \n 1.2 Methodology  \nThe methodology of this report is briefly described below:  \ni. This report will conduct a secondary research with the sample of  listed companies of \nPharmaceuticals & Chemicals and Food & Allied industry in Bangladesh . The analysis will \ncover information from 2011 to 2021.  Data will be collected from the website of Dhaka Stock \nExchange and LankaBangla Financial Portal.  \nii. Three models will be developed with three different performance metrics (ROA, ROE and \nNAV) as dependent variables . \niii. Nine independent variables will be observed to investigate their impact on the three models.  \niv. Stata version 15 will be used as the software for e mpirical analysis of the study . \nThis conforms  the methodology of the report  in short . The methodology in detail will be discussed in \nResearch Design (Chapter – 3).  \n1.3 Limitation of the Study  \nThis report  consists of some limitations as well.  The limitatio ns are described below:  \nv. One of the main limitations is that this report only could include the  data of publicly listed \ncompanies, the private  companies were excluded.  \nvi. Lack of experience and knowledge of the subject matter as in Bangladesh, the topic is not  \nstudied frequently.  \nvii. Furthermore, the causality of the correlation  between board diversity and company  \nperformance is unknown , as it is difficult to establish whether board diversity causes better \nfirm performance, or whether better firm performance enable s firms to diversify their boards.  \nviii. The lack of a uniform definition and standardization of board diversity measures across studies \nmakes it challenging to compare results and draw conclusions.  \nThere are a few limitations conducting this report. These limitations cannot be neglected and should \nbe kept in consideration while completing the report.   \n15 \n Chapter - 2 \nTheoretical Development and Previous Studies  \nChapter 2 focuses on  theoretical developments based on boardroom review, stakeholder management, \nagency issue and some previous literatures on impact of board diversity on performance of firms.  \n2.1 Theoretical Development  \nSeveral  related theories have been developed that enlighten  the study on diverse boardroom review \nand institutional management. Some o f these include  the following : \n2.1.1 Board Room Review  \nBoardroom review is a critical process  and an  aspect of corporate governance through which the board \nof directors evaluates its own performance, as well as the performance of individual directors, with  the \naim of identifying areas of strong points  and weak points  and improving overall efficacy . It provides a \nmechanism for improving the board's ability to provide strategic direction, monitor management, and \nensure accountability to shareholders.  It typic ally involves several key steps:  \n Establishing the Sc ope and Objectives of the Review: The board should define the scope of \nthe review, including the board's performance  and the spe cific objectives of the review such as \nreviewing the board's composition, pr ocesses, and effectiveness in relation to its oversight \nresponsibilities, including risk management, financial reporting, and strategic planning.  \n Collecting and Analyzing Data:  The board should collect and analyze relevant da ta to \nevaluate its performance conducting interviews, surveys, or focus groups, as well as reviewing \nboard meeting minutes and other relevant documents.  \n Identifying Areas f or Improvement:  Based on the data collected, the board should identify \nareas of strength and weakness and develop r ecommendations for improving performance.  \n Implementing and Monitoring Improvements:  The board should implement the \nrecommended improvements and monitor progress over time. This may involve making \nchanges to board composition, processes, or policies, as we ll as providing training and \ndevelopment opportunities for individual directors.  \nAlso there are some  certain practices to be avoided in board room review that may hinder the \neffectiveness of the process. Some of these include:  \n Confirmation Bias:  This occur s when reviewers or interpret information in a way that \nconfirms their existing beliefs, rather than objectively evaluating the available evidence.  \n Groupthink:  Here  group members prioritize agreement and consensus over critical evaluation \nand independent t hinking. This can lead to a failure to identify potential risks or drawbacks.  \n Tokenism:  It indicates that members are added to the board solely for the purpose of improving \ndiversity metrics, rather than for their skills, experience, or perspective.  \n Lack of Follow -up: Even when a board room review identifies areas for improvement, it is \nimportant to follow up on the recommendations and take concrete actions to address the \nidentified issues.  \n16 \n Boardroom review is a continuous process, and it should be conduc ted on a regular basis to ensure that \nthe board is functioning effectively and meeting its oversight responsibilities. By conducting regular \nboardroom reviews, companies can improve their corporate governance and enhance their capability  \nto construct  lasting value for shareholders and other interested parties . \nBoardroom review consists of five key steps. The following section discusses the steps with charts.  \nBoardroom Review Program  \nBoardroom Review  is a comprehensive performance evaluation process designed to assess the \neffectiveness of an organization's senior leadership team.  \nFigure 1: The Boardroom Review Progr am \n \nSource:  Developed from different published materials  \n \nThe above figure demonstrates Board Room Review program  which starts with a corporate objective \nand goal and ends with implementation program. The program typically evaluates the present situation  \nof the boardroom  and the senior administration  team, and implem ents probable governance options. It \nmay also include feedback from key stakeholders such as customers, employees, and shareholders.  The \nreview process should be conducted with strict confidentiality to encourage honest and open feedback \nfrom participants and clearly communicated to all participants to ensure their buy -in and engagement. \nAn independent third -party consultant or advisory firm  is encouraged  to conduct the review to ensure \nobjectivity and avoid conflicts of interest.  \n \n \n\n17 \n Corporate Objectives and  Governance  \nCorporate objectives and governance are important considerations in boardroom reviews, as they \nprovide a n agenda  for estimating  a company's performance and success.  The complete corporate \ngovernance can be observed at a glance with this section . These objectives may include funding \nsources, management ability, training employees, government and international perspective.  \n \nFigure 2: Corporate Objectives and Governance  \n \nSource:  Developed from different published materials  \n \nThe boardroom review starts with corporate objectives and governance and this figure describes the \ndetails of corporate objective and governance. The objective and governance include the vision and \nstandards of the organization, the government regulatory a uthority, the organization structure, \nmanagement ability and employees, their training and involvement plans, as well as the funding \nproviders and international perspective and growth. All of them together serve as the corporate \nobjective and governance.   \n\n18 \n Internal Review  \nAn Internal Board Room Review is conducting a review process on the internal aspects of an \norganization . The purpose of an internal review is to assess the performance of the senior leadership \nteam and identify areas where they can improve . Some of the benefit s of an internal review include \nthat the i nternal reviewers are often more familiar with the organization's  culture, processes, and goals \nand can help to promote transparency and accounta bility within the organization with a lower cost . But \nit also incurs some biases or preconceptions about the organization or senior leadership team, which \ncould i mpact the review's objectivity. Internal reviewers may have limited perspectives on the \norganization's performance, as they are often closely involve d in the day -to-day operations. Also the \nsenior leaders within the organization may be resistant to change or unwilling to acknowledge areas \nwhere they need to improve, which could limit the effectiveness of the review.  \n \nFigure 3: The Internal Review  \n \nSource:  Developed from different published materials  \n \nThe internal review starts with the present board analysis and analyses other aspects related to the \ncompany such as R&D, audits, management team, subsidiaries, corporate affairs etc. and ends with \nanalyzing the present overall situation.  \n  \n\n19 \n External Review  \nAn External Board Room Review is conducting a review process on the outside parties of an \norganization which includes shareholders, stakeholders, governments, financial world and other \npartner . The purpose of an external review is to provide an unbiased and objective evaluation of the \nperformance of the senior leadership team. Some of the benefits  of an external review include that the \nexternal reviewers bring an objective and fresh perspective  with broader expertise and greater \ncredibility to the review process. They are not bound by internal biases or preconceptions, which can \nhelp to identify blind spots and uncover new insights. But it comes with expensive costs and limited \naccess to interna l information . \nFigure 4: The Outside Review  \n \nSource:  Developed from different published materials  \n \nThe outside or external review first considers the impact of the outside to the company, and then \nanalyzes the governance aspects and present situation. The  review then moves forward to the final \nstage for the implementation program.  \n  \n\n20 \n Implementation Program  \nIn the last stage, the implementation program takes place. This section works according to the previous \nanalysis and formulates new strategies, policies and finds the gap between the target and the actual \nresults. This section also analyses the internal strength and weaknesses and external opportunities and \nthreats.  \nFigure 5: The Implementation Program  \n \nSource:  Developed from different published materials  \n \nThe selected governance option is then evaluated through present and future regulatory pressures and \ncorporate pressures. After finding the gaps, the implementation takes place with board development, \nrecruitment, training, committees and subsidiary boar ds.  \n\n21 \n The following part discusses Agency Theory, Upper Echelon Theory, Stakeholder Theory, Critical \nMass Theory, Institutional Theory, Resource Depe ndence  Theory and Social Identity Theory.  \n2.1.2 Agency Theory  \nAgency Theory posits that a fundamental confli ct exists between a company's owners and its managers. \nBoard diversity, as per Agency Theory, can enhance the effectiveness of corporate governance \nprocesses, thus reducing agency costs and ultimately leading to better firm performance. This theory \nwas fir st introduced by economists Michael Jensen and William Meckling in their seminal 1976 work, \n\"Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure.\" According to \nAgency Theory, shareholders delegate the task of daily management and  decision -making to \nprofessional managers called agents.  \nThe idea of agency costs, which refers to the expenses made by the owner in order to administrate  the \nconduct of the agent or management and minimize the agency problem, is one of the main \nbreakthroughs of agency theory. These expenses include of monitoring, bonding, and residual loss \ncharges. The theory can assist businesses in recognizing and managi ng potential conflicts of interest \nby outlining the various agency costs. However, there might be additional processes that can potentially \nlower agency costs, such as good corporate governance and regulation.  \nThe agency theory has several important implic ations for understanding organizational behavior, \ncorporate governance, and financial decision -making.  \n The agency theory's emphasis on the value of coordinating the core interest  of principal and \nagent is one of its major contributions. According to the th eory, when ownership and control \nare separated in an organization, managerial and shareholder conflicts of interest may develop, \nresulting in agency costs that lower business value. This can be lessened by employing \nmeasures like executive compensation, bo ard of directors ’ oversight, and market competition.  \n The agency theory highlights the role of knowledge asymmetry in decision -making, which is \nanother significant implication. According to the hypothesis, managers may be inclined to \nprioritize their own in terests over those of the shareholders because they often have more \nknowledge about the operations and financial performance of the company than shareholders. \nIncreased disclosure standards and transparency can help with this.  \nDespite its many contribution s, the agency theory also has several limitations.  \n One of the main criticisms of the theory is that it assumes that individuals are solely motivated \nby self -interest, which may not always be the case.  \n In addition, the agency theory can be difficult to te st empirically because it relies on \nassumptions about unobserved behaviors and motivations.  \n Finally, the theory does not account for the role of other stakeholders, such as employees and \ncustomers, in organizational decision -making.  \nOverall, agency theory  has been instrumental in shaping the field of corporate governance and has \ninfluenced many aspects of modern business practice, including executive compensation, board \nstructure and composi tion, and shareholder activism.  \n22 \n 2.1.3 Upper Echelon Theory  \nAccord ing to the Top Management Team Theory  (TMT) , also known as the Upper Echelon Theory, \nthe traits of top executives, including board members, can significantly affect a company's \nperformance. Board diversity can also increase the cognitive diversity of the T MT, which will improve \ndecision -making and performance. Donald Hambrick and Phyllis Mason first put out this notion in \n1984. The thesis contends that TMT traits like age, education, and experience can have a big influence  \non strategic choices and eventuall y on the performance of the organiz ation. The upper echelon theory's \nsignificance arises from its emphasis on the part that senior management t eams play in determining \norganiz ational outcomes. Add itionally, it can assist organiz ations in forming management  teams that \nperform better. But there are further  limitations to this theory and they are:  \n It assumes  that the characteristics of top management teams are the only determinants of \nstrategic decisions and firm performance. Other factors such as organization al structure, \nindustry and external environmental factors can also influence organizational outcomes.  \n Additionally, the theory does not account for the possibility that TMT characteristics may be \ninfluenced by organizational outcomes rather than the other  way around.  \nOverall, the upper echelon theory provides valuable insights into the impact of top management \ncharacteristics on organizational outcomes. However, its limitations must be recognized, and it should \nbe applied in conjunction with other theories  and considerations.  \n2.1.4 Stakeholder Theory   \nAccording to the stakeholder theory, businesses have an obligation to generate value for a variety of \nstakeholders, including staff members, clients, suppliers, and the general public. This strategy was first \ncovered by R. Edward Freeman in his 1984 book \"Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach.\" \nStakeholder theory argues for board diversity in the context of improving social and financial \nperformance by helping firms better underst and and adapt to the various needs and preferences of its \nstakeholders. The significance of stakeholder theory acknowledges that businesses have an impact on \nsociety and the environment that may have lasting effects on both the firm and the larger communit y. \nStakeholder theory encourages companies to take a more holistic approach to their decision -making, \ntaking into account the interests and needs of a broader range of stakeholders.  However, there are also \nlimitations to stakeholder theory.  \n One of the mai n criticisms is that it can be difficult to define and prioritize stakeholders, \nespecially when their interests may conflict with each other.  \n Additionally, some argue that a focus on stakeholder interests can detract from the primary \ngoal of creating shar eholder value.  \n Critics also argue that it can be difficult to measure the success of stakeholder management, as \nthe benefits may be diffuse and difficult to quantify.  \nDespite these criticisms, stakeholder theory remains an important and influential framework for \nunderstanding the responsibilities of businesses and the relationships they have with a wider range of \nstakeholders.  \n23 \n 2.1.5 Critical Mass Theory  \nAccording to the critical mass theory, for minority representation on a board to significantly aff ect \ndecision -making and group dynamics, there must be a sufficient number of them. The critical mass \nhypothesis was first put forth by Kanter in 1977 and later explored in the 1990s by academics like Cox \nand Blake. This idea contends that when there is a c ritical mass of at least three women or members of \nunderrepresented groups on a board, those individuals are more likely to be heard, have their opinions \nand contributions appreciated, and have an impact on the board's culture. Major implications of this \ntheory are:  \n The critical mass theory is particularly relevant in the context of board diversity, where having \nonly one or two diverse members may not be sufficient to create a significant impact on \ndecision -making and group dynamics.  \n The theory was initial ly developed in the context of gender diversity on boards, but it has since \nbeen applied to other forms of diversity as well. It has been supported by empirical evidence \nin several studies, which have found that companies with a critical mass of women or m inority \nboard are likely  to have better financial performance, higher levels of innovation, and more \neffective governance.  \nHowever, the critical mass theory also has some limitations.  \n One potential limitation is that it assumes that all women or minority board members share \nsimilar perspectives and experiences, which may not always be the case.  \n The theory does not provide clear guidance on what constitutes a critical mass for different \ntypes of diversity, and this may vary depending on the industry, compa ny size or other factors.  \n2.1.6 Institutional Theory  \nAccording to the Institutional Theory, an organiza tion's environment's socio -cultural norms and \nexpectations have an impact on it. Meyer and Rowan are credited for creating institutional theory in \n1977 . The notion states that organiz ations are more likely to achieve validity and backing from \nstakeholders if they adhere to the expectations of their surroundings. Therefore, having a diverse board \nof directors may be seen as a means for businesses to live up  to social expectations and demonstrate \ntheir commitment to corporate social responsibility.  However,  institutional theory has been criticized \nfor several limitations.  \n The theory does not provide a detailed examination of power relations among organization s \nand stakeholders. As a result, it does not offer a comprehensive understanding of how \ninstitutions and their members  interact to influence organizational behavior.  \n It tends to focus on external factors, such as the norms and values of society, and may ov erlook \ninternal dynamics within the organization, such as the power struggles among  board  members.  \n The institutional theory may oversimplify the complex nature of institutions and the different \ninterests and members  involved in the institutionalization pro cess. This can lead to an \noversimplification of the role of diversity in shaping institutional change.  \n24 \n 2.1.7 Resource Dependence Theory  \nAccording to the resource dependence theory, enterprises' ability to function and exist depends on \naccess to outside res ources including information, skill, and funding. Acco rding to the notion, how \norganiz ations are given power and influence in relation to their external environment affects how they \nact and make decisions. Jeffrey Pfeffer and Gerald Salancik created the th eory in the late 1970s. \nAccording to the resource dependence hypothesis , diverse boards can aid organiz ations in acquiring \noutside resources and knowledge from a wider range of sources. A diverse board can offer a diversity \nof viewpoints and experiences th at can assist a company in recogniz ing and adapting to environmental \nchanges. However, the theory  has some li mitations.  \n The theory assumes that organizations are equal in their relationships, which may not be the \ncase. Organizations with more resources may  be able to exert more power over others.  \n The theory focuses on the external factor s that influence organizations and does not consider \ninternal factors such as org anizational culture, leadership  or decision -making processes.  \n While this theory highlights t he importance of resource acquisition, it does not provide clear \nguidance on how organizations should allocate their resources to achieve their goals.  \n The theory assumes that organizations have a stable environment. However, with the ever -\nchanging business  environment, this assumption may not hold true in all cases.  \nOverall, resource dependence theory highlights the importance of external factors in shaping \norganization al behavior and decision -making . \n2.1.8 Social Identity T heor y \nSocial Identity Theory (SIT) describes  in what way  individuals identify with and form perceptions of \ngroups to which they belong, such as race, gender, nationality, or organization. In the context of board \ndiversity, individuals form a part of different so cial groups and identify with them based on their shared \ncharacteristics. These social groups can influence individuals' behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions. \nSIT was first proposed by Henri Tajfel and John Turner in 1979. Its application to the field of board \ndiversity is relatively recent, and further  work  is required  to completely  understand the role of social \nidentity in board decision -making and performance.  Yet, there might be some limitations:  \n One potential limitation of social identity theory in th e context of board diversity is that it may \nreinforce existing social hierarchies and power structures, rather than challenging them. For \nexample, if a board is predominantly composed of white men, a social identity perspective \nmight suggest that they will  work more effectively together because they share a common \nidentity. However, this perspective overlooks the potential benefits of diversity and the ways \nin which a more diverse group of board members might be able to bring different perspectives \nand expe riences to the table.  \n Additionally, social identity theory may not fully capture the complexities of individual \nidentities and the ways in which they intersect with other aspects of a person's experie nce such \nas their socioeco nomic status or education lev el. \nThese theories can provide a theoretical structure  for the study of board diversity and help to guide the \ndevelopment of research hypotheses and the interpretation of research findings.  \n25 \n 2.2 Previous Studies  \nThere have been a great number of research pa pers that have investigated the correlation  between \ndiverse board membership and effective business performance . Multiple pieces of research have \npointed to a beneficial connection between diverse board membership and strong financial success. \nAccording to  the findings of a study by Credit Suisse (2012), businesses that had as a minimum  of one \nfemale director  serving on their board had a greater return on equity and a higher valuation than \nbusinesses that had all -male boards. According to research conducted  by McKinsey & Company \n(2011), businesses with diverse boards of directors had a greater chance of outperforming their \ncompetitors on a variety of financial indicators. These metrics included return on equity and earnings \ngrowth. According to research cond ucted by Deloitte (2013), businesses with diverse boards of \ndirectors were found to have a higher likelihood of having a formal risk management procedure in \nplace, as well as to be better equipped to address new risks. Although diversity can take various f orms, \nsuch as race, ethnicity, age, and experience, the most widely researched form of diversity on corpor ate \nboards is gender diversity. It probably relates  to the fact that women are underrepresented group on \ncorporate boards, and there has been a rising  realization of how important it is to have gender diversity \nin the boardroom in recent years. However, other types of diversity, such as age, experience, racial \ndiversity and the presence of government board members, are also evaluated by the researchers.   \nOzkan et al. studied on Board Diversity, Corporate Governance, and Firm Performance, based on the \nevidence from Turkey in 2015. This study looked at the connection between corporate governance, \nboard diversity, and firm performance in Turkey. The researc hers discovered a link between board \ndiversity and company performance, and they also discovered that this link was more pronounced for \ncompanies with greater corporate governance.  Similarly, Lemaire et al. published an article in 2019 \nabout the business p erformance on the basis of the contribution of female directors. They studied board \ndiversity, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and performance of the company. It investigated the \nconnection between the representation of female director and CSR in Fre nch companies. The \nresearchers discovered that companies with a greater number of women on their boards had a higher \npropensity to participate in CSR activities. They also discovered that this correlation could be partially \nexplained by the variety of expe riences and capabilities that women possess.  \nMuhammad and Khattak (2021) wrote an article on “Board Diversity and Firm Performance: The \nMediating Effects of Board Pro cess and Task Conflict.\". The researchers focused on  Pakistani \nenterprises  to complete the  study . According to the findings of the study, the researchers discovered \nthat the re was  positive impact of diverse board  on company  performance  in Pakistan . And the growth  \nwas mediated not only by the quality of board procedures but also by the level of task conflict that \nexisted on the board.  Moreover, Marinova et al. wrote an article that reviewed the previous research \non board diversity in 2019. This piece identified imp ortant research gaps and directions for the \ndevelopment of future research on board diversity. The authors argue that there needs to be greater \ninvestigation into the specifi c processes through which variety in members of the board influences \ncompany growt h, profitability and better performance, as well as the role that institutional and cultural \nfactors play in determining the relationship between board diversity and firm outcomes.  \n26 \n 2.2.1 Impact of Gender Diversity and Firm Performance  \nThe viewpoint that fe male directors as board members bring to the table is only one manner in which \na board benefits from diversity. Here, we shall discuss some of the earlier research that have been \nreviewed at the national and international levels. In addition to the experts ' original findings, the studies \nalso include those that run opposed to the prevailing theory. Numerous studies from all over the world \nhave looked into the correlation between gender diversity and the overall success of enterprises. A \nstudy by Jianjun et al. (2016) looked into how having women on business boards in China affected \ntheir CSR efforts. The study's findings suggest that businesses with more women on their boards are \nmore likely to invest in environmental initiatives. In 2016, Bennedsen et al. i nvestigated the correlation \nbetween the presence of women on boards of directors and financial performance in Danish publicly \ntraded companies. This research looked specifically at the dynamics between female board members \nand publicly traded companies in Denmark. A study indicated that having women on the board of \ndirectors improved the company's bottom line. Companies in the Netherlands and Denmark were \nstudied by Groeneveld and Stoker (2015), who looked into the correlation between gender diversity on \nboards of directors and financial success. The study's results indicated a strong link between the \npresence of women on corporate boards and the bottom lines of their respective businesses.  \nStaglian et al. published an article in 2018 titled \"The Effect of W omen Directors on Firm Performance: \nEvidence from Italy\" in which they discussed the findings of research that they had undertaken on the \nconnection between the presence of female board members and the level of success that companies in \nItaly experienced. In particular, the research concentrated on businesses located in Italy. According to \nthe results of the research, having women on a company's board of directors has a positive influence \non the business as a whole and can help it achieve greater success. I n their 2016 study, Bouaiss and \nAubert investigated how the existence  of women on corporate boards affected the value, performance, \nand risk of companies based in France and the United Kingdom. The study looked at both the French \nand UK markets for its fin dings. The article's title is \"The Impact of Women on Corporate Boards on \nFirm Value, Performance, and Risk: A Study of the French and UK Markets.\" The economies of France \nand the United Kingdom serve as the primary research foci for this study. The outcom es of the study \nindicated that the presence of female board members had a positive impact on the value and \nperformance of the firm, but had a negative impact on the risk that the company was exposed to.  \nThe article titled \"Women on Corporate Boards in Chi na: An Exploratory Study\" was published by \nJianxin et al. in 2016. It investigated the presence of women on corporate boards in China and the \nperformance of the firms. Researchers found that the existence  of women on a company's board had a \npositive impact  on its performance. Abor et al. (2019) also found it very crucial to have opinions and \npower of female directors to get successful business performance . \"Gender Diversity in the Boardroom \nand Firm Performance: Evidence from Ghana\" The findings of the stud y indicated that having board \nmembers of various genders has a positive effect on the company's overall success. Kocak and Olga \n(2020) published an article titled \"Female Board Representation and Corporate Innovation: Evidence \nfrom Canadian Public Firms\". The research on Canadian public companies  disclosed that having \nwomen on board successfully enhanced company profitability and growth . Moreover, it positively \naffected corporate innovation.  \n27 \n Ammar and Khlif (2016) investigated the participation of female di rectors  on corporate boards in the \nMiddle East and North Africa, as well as their involvement and positive returns earned by the company . \nAccording to the discoveries  of the study, former had a beneficial effect on the latter . A similar study \nby Chou et al . (2019) examined was titled \"Do Women Directors Affect Firm Perfor mance? Evidence \nfrom Hong Kong\".  This paper also confirmed that having a diverse board of directors evolve varieties \nof ideas on board meetings which eventually bring greater good to the co mpany whereas having a \nnarrow and non -diverse board fails to develop any innovative ideas and success. Research conducted \nby several authors suggests that companies with a higher representation of female directors tend to \nhave better financial performance.  Carter et al. (2003) found that firms with a greater proportion of \nfemale directors had higher returns on assets, equity, and investments, as well as lower debt -to-equity \nratios. Similarly, Darmadi (2011) discovered a positive effect on the performance of  businesses in \nIndonesia when female directors were appointed. Similarly, Hillman et al. (2000) found that the \nprevalence of women on corporate boards in the United States was positively correlated with firm \nfinancial performance. Ho and Wong (2001) report ed that firms in Hong Kong with a higher \nproportion of female directors had superior financial performance. Rose (2007) found that firms \nwith more female directors in the United Kingdom had superior financial performance and higher \nmarket valuations. Terje sen et al. (2016) found a positive correlation between the presence of \nwomen on corporate boards and firm performance in Portugal.  In addition, Weisner et al. (2018) \ndiscovered that the appointment of female directors in Finland had a positive effect on fi rm \nperformance. Similarly, Wilson and Altman (2014) found that the appointment of female directors \nin the United States was associated with enhanced financial performance. Yermack (1996) found \nthat firms with more female directors in the United States had higher stock returns and profitability.  \nThese findings suggest that having a more diverse board of directors, including more women, can lead \nto better financial performance for companies. The reasons behind this positive correlation may include \ndiverse per spectives, improved decision -making processes, and greater talent diversity within the \norganization. However, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, \nand further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms behind these findings.  \nCountry -wise the conclusion of the impact can be different or even opposite . Where some other \ndeveloped and developing countries urged the necessity of female board member for business success, \nBangladesh can reveal deviat ing results if studied accurately. But the good news is that  Bangladesh \nhas not been left behind in researching the impact of female board members on company performance. \nA study by Khan and Hossain (2015) revealed that companies with a higher proportion o f female \ndirectors in companies listed on the DSE had superior financial performance, as indicated by return on \nassets and return on equity. Similarly, to further support this notion, Aktar et al. (2017) , Haque et al. \n(2015) found that the appointment of female directors had a positive effect on firm performance, as \nmeasured by return on asset, return on equity and Tobin's Q. Bari and Bhuiyan (2020) also found a \npositive correlation between the presence of female directors on corporate boards and firm \nperformance, as measured by return on assets and return on equity in their study of 144 companies \nlisted on the Dhaka Stock Exchange. In addition, Nahar et al. (2019) analyzed data from 300 companies \nlisted on the Dhaka Stock Exch ange and discovered that the appointment of female directors improved \nfinancial performance, as measured by return on assets and return on equity.  \n28 \n Data from 138 Dhaka Stock Exchange -listed companies was reviewed by Rahman and Karim (2015). \nThey found that  companies with women on their boards performed better in terms of return on assets \nand total shareholder return. Tobin's Q. Hoque et al. (2021) analyzed information from 137 Dhaka \nStock Exchange -listed companies. Female director appointments were found to  improve firm \nperformance as measured by return on assets and return on equity. These studies conclude that the \npresence of women on a board of directors in Bangladesh is associated with improved financial \nperformance on a variety of metrics. The findings from these studies suggest that having more women \non corporate boards in Bangladesh positively impacts the financial performance of companies. This \nmay be due to the fact that women bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the table, which can \nlead to  better decision -making processes and talent diversity within the organization. These findings \nare significant, as they underscore the importance of gender diversity in corporate leadership positions \nin emerging economies like Bangladesh.  \nWhile the vast ma jority of research has found an upward trend between the number of women on \nboards and enhanced company performance, there are also s ome studies that have found no connection \nbetween the number of women on boa rds and company performance. According to the r esults, gender \ndiversity is not necessarily a positive factor when it comes to the bottom lines of businesses. Adams \nand Ferreira's (2009) analysis of the correlation between the number of women on corporate boards \nand financial indicators including ROA, R OE, and Tobin's Q found no statistically significant \ncorrelation. The study analyzed information from nearly 2,000 businesses in 23 different nations. The \nrelated variables were not found to be significant in their research. Campbell and Minguez -Vera (2008 ) \nexamined data from more than 200 Spanish companies and found that having more women on \ncorporate boards was associated with improved financial success. They also determined that this effect \nwas limited to a fixed fraction. The positive effect that having  more women on the board had on the \ncompany's performance tapered off after a specific threshold was reached. Companies comprising the \nS&P 500 index were studied by Minton et al. (2017). They found that while inclusion of both  men and \nwomen on boards had a  null effect on short -term performance (as assessed by one -year stock returns), \nit had a mixed effect on long -term performance (as measured by Tobin's Q).  After reviewing 67 papers, \nTerjesen et al. (2009) concluded that there was a weak and inconsistent in teraction between a gender \nbalance on committees and corporate performance. According the study, there was no need for having \na diversity in terms of gender to improve the business’s performance.  \nSince the investigations contradicted one another, this was  the conclusion reached by the researchers. \nThe researchers speculated that other factors, such the board's size and independence, might be more \nimportant for the company's success. It should be noted, however, that a significant number of studies \nin this area have found a favorable correlation between having women on the board and the success of \nthe business. Despite the fact that these studies suggest the connection between an independent board \nof directors and a successful company is not always clear or universal, it is crucial to remember that \nthe vast majority of study evidence in this area does reveal an upward correlation between the two. \nThis is not something to be disregarded.   \n29 \n 2.2.2  Impact of Independent Board Members on Firm Performance  \nThe number and distribution of board members who are independent  is one component of diversity \nthat contri butes to a board's efficiency. H aving one or a few independent directors on board can bring \nnot only better profitability but also better inspection a nd auditing which eventually reduces wastage \ncosts and adultery. Several earlier studies that have been analyzed on a national and international scale \nare presented below. These studies include both the researchers' original findings and contrasting \nstudie s that challenge established knowledge. Independent board membership has been studied \nextensively in an effort to determine if and how it affects a company's bottom line. Kuo and Chen's \n(2015) research \"The Impact of Independent Board Members on Firm Perfo rmance: Evidence from \nTaiwan\" looked into the link between independent board members and firm performance in Taiwan. \nIndependent board members were found to have an advantageous connection to the overall \nperformance of the company, as determined by the stu dy's findings. And they found that the correlation \nwas even higher between poor corporate governance and lower profits. In a paper titled \"Independent \nDirectors and Firm Performance in Chinese State -Owned Enterprises,\" Liu et al. (2019) looked into \nhow it relates between outside directors and the success of state -owned businesses in China. The study's \nauthors found that having outside directors is linked to better financial results for businesses. \nAdditionally, they found that the statistical association wa s stronger for politically connected \nbusinesses.  \nThe research titled \"Board Independence and Firm Performance: Evidence from India\" by Srimathy \nand Arunachalam (2018) investigated this hypothesis. The nation of India was the target of this specific \nresearc h project. The study's authors found that having independent directors is linked to better \nfinancial results for businesses. In addition, they found that the correlation was larger in companies \nthat had a wide range of product lines. South Korean company p erformance was studied by Kim et al. \n(2018), who looked into the link involving board independence and financial success. Independent \ndirectors were shown to have a larger correlation with boosted company efficiency in companies with \nweaker governance fram eworks, as found by the study's authors. Board independence was found to \nhave a positive effect on the profitability of Malaysian family firms, according to research by Nawai \net al. (2018). The study's authors found that having independent directors is lin ked to better financial \nresults for businesses. They also found that the correlation was more robust in companies where the \nfounding family still held a substantial stake.  \nChen and Kuo (2014) published another study that explores the association between i ndependence of \nboards and company performance in Chinese listed enterprises. The findings showed that companies \nwith weaker governance systems benefited more from having independent directors on their boards. \nSuccessful Russian companies may have a lot to thank for the research conducted by Shmatko et al. in \n2016. The study's findings showed that companies with weaker governance systems benefited more \nfrom having independent directors on their boards. Teshima and Gokan (2016), in their article titled \n\"Board  Composition and Firm Performance in Japan: Evidence from the Manufacturing Sector,\" \nconducted research board composition and company performance in the manufacturing sector in Japan. \nAccording to the findings of the study, the researchers discovered that the presence of independent \ndirectors was related with improved company  performance, and that this connection  was stronger for \nbusinesses that had less effective governance systems.  \n30 \n Karaosman and Memili (2019), in their study explored the link that exists between board diversity and \nthe performance of corporations  that are listed in the United Kingdom. In particular, they focused on \nthe performance of firms that include independent  board members. According to the results of the \nstudy, having a number of ind ependent and unbiased  executives on board  was shown to be related with \nimproved business performance. In addition, they found that this link was stronger for companies \nwhich had a substantial amount of diversity represented on their boards of directors. Mo usa and \nMurinde (2016) conducted yet another study that looked into the connection between independent \nboard of directors and successful business operations in the UK. This study, which examined \ninformation from businesses that were in compliance with the Combined Code.  The researchers found \nthat the addition of directors who were independent was connected with improved firm performance, \nand that such an association was stronger for organizations that had less effective governance \nstructures. The outcomes o f the study showed that the authors uncovered that the position of \nindependently directors correlates with higher company performance. Rezae et al. (2018) investigated \nthe relationship between the composition of a board of directors and the performance of a company  in \nthe United Arab Emirates. The results of their research were presented in an article titled \"Board \nComposition and Firm Performance: Evidence from the UAE.\" The researchers found that the presence \nof independent directors was connected with im proved firm performance, and that this relationship \nwas stronger for organizations that had less effective governance structures. The outcomes of the study \nshowed that the authors learned about that the participation of independent directors was related wi th \nenhanced the operation of the company  \nAmekawu and Quaye (2019) used data from companies located in South Africa for their research on \nthe linkage between board independence and the performance of firms in Sub -Saharan Africa. Their \nstudy focused on the i nteraction between these two factors. The researchers found that the presence of \nindependent directors was connected with improved firm performance, and that this relationship was \nstronger for organizations that had less effective governance structures. Th e outcomes of the study \nshowed that the examiners observed company performed way more successfully when the board \nconsisted of independent directors. The authors of the 2017 research titled \"Corporate Governance and \nFirm Performance in Ghana\",  Fosu and Iss ah, explored the interaction between efficient corporate \nmanagement and the success of enterprises in Ghana. The researchers found that the presence of \nindependent directors was connected with improved firm performance, and that this relationship was \nstron ger for organizations that had less effective governance structures. This also works as an evidence \nfor the necessity of independent board members in the corporation. In a separate piece of research, \nSehgal and Singh (2019) looked into whether or not there  is a correlation between the independence \nof boards of directors and the performance of companies in India. The researchers found that the \npresence of independent directors was connected with improved firm performance, and that this \nrelationship was stron ger for organizations that had less effective governance structures. There are \nmany more studies internationally that found the necessity of having diversity on board as independent \ndirectors to get a superior performance by the company. The urge of having  such elaborated research \nin Bangladesh is also very high now -a-days.  \n \n31 \n Without a shadow of a doubt, the quantity of research carried out in Bangladesh on this specific topic \nis insufficient. Researchers in Bangladesh have not undertaken a significant amoun t of study on the \ninfluence that board diversity has on the success of organizations. Even more specifically, researchers \nin Bangladesh have not conducted research on board composition in terms of internal and outside \ndirectors. On the other hand, there ar en't many studies on independent boards and the performance of \nbusinesses in Bangladesh that are useful for my research. The study  that Ferdousi and Asaduzzaman \nconducted and titled \"Board Structure and Firm Performance: Evidence from Bangladesh\" is an \nillustration of this kind of study. This article from the 2019 volume of the International Journal of \nBusiness and Management presents the findings of a study that looked at the connection between the \nmake -up of a company's board of directors and its overall performance. An inquiry was carried out \nutilizing a sample of fifty different firms that were traded on the DSE  as the basis for the investigation. \nThe findings of the study indicate that a positive correlation exists between the success of a company \nand t he number  of independent directors that serve on the board. On the other hand, the findings \nindicate that a negative association exists between the success of a company and the number of \ninternal  directors that serve on the board. However, the function of government board members was \nnot investigated in any greater detail than was necessary for the purpose of the study.  \nThe study of Rashid  and Ahmed  (2016) was published in the International Journal of Econo mics, \nCommerce, and Management. The authors looked into the causal connection that exists between the \nindependent directors on boards and the monetary success of thirty different listed firms in Bangladesh. \nThe positive correlation works as an evidence of the necessity of having independent board member \nin Bangladeshi companies. In 2017, Islam and Miyan contributed an article to the Journal of Business \nand Technology (Dhaka), which was published in Bangladesh. They used a sample of 80 different \ncompanies that were listed in Bangladesh in order to conduct re search into the effect that independent \ndirectors have on the performance of companies. The findings of the study indicate that the presence \nof independent board members has a significant impact, both positively and significantly, on the overall \nsuccess of  a company. Using a sample of 120 different listed companies  in Bangladesh, Rahman and \nNurunnabi (2019) investigated whether or not there is a correlation between the membership of a \ncompany's board of directors and its overall performance. According to th e findings of the study, the \npresence of outside directors has a beneficial effect on the organization as a whole in terms of its level \nof achievement.  \nRahman and Akhtar (2017) investigate d the effect that strong corporate governance has on the overall \nsuccess of Bangladesh's banking industry. Specifically, they were interested in the effect that good \ngovernance has on the performance of individual businesses. According to the findings of the study, \ngood corporate governance have a positive impact on the fi nancial performance of financial institutions \nlike banks. The result works as an evidence of the necessity of having independent board member in \nBangladeshi companies for better profitability of the banks. Similarly,  Hossain and Khan (2018) \ninvestigated the connection between good corporate governance and successful business operations in \nthe pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh. According to the findings of the study, independent \ndirectors have a beneficial effect o n the performance of businesses in Bangladesh.  \n \n32 \n Contrary to the positive findings of the majority of research studies, there are a few studies that have \nrevealed little to no association between the two. These studies have revealed little or no association  \nbetween the two. Within the context of the Cadbury Committee's recommendations about the topic of \ncorporate governance, the research that was conducted in 1997 by Clubb and Turner looked into the \nconnection that exists in the United Kingdom between board composition and the success of \ncompanies. The researchers could not discover a lot of data to back up their claim that board \ncomposition was associated to improved business performance. Alisjahbana and Fahlevi's (2014) \nresearch studied the association betw een business performance and the membership of the board of \ndirectors in Indonesian companies. A statistic that was used to analyze the overall composition of the \nboard was the number of independent directors that were serving on the board. The researchers  were \nunable to find any evidence to support their hypothesis that an independent board was associated with \nbetter levels of economic performance in Indonesia. In addition, Mukherjee and Gupta (2014) looked \ninto the relationship between independent directo rs and the overall success of enterprises in Indonesia. \nAs measured by return on assets, return on equity, and Tobin's Q, the researchers found that there was \nno correlation between the number of independent directors and increased business success in \nIndonesia. This was one of the theories that the investigators looked into further. A paper  by Nakamura \nand Nakamura (2007) was based on Japan’s firm performance during 1985 -1998. The findings of the \nstudy indicate that the presence of independent directors on  boards of directors has very little impact \non the success of the organization as a whole.  \nGill and Reisman (2016) carried out research in Israeli businesses to investigate the link between board \nindependence and the performance of the company. The researc hers were unable to identify any \nsignificant connection between the autonomy of the board of directors and the efficienc y of the \norganization. Balasubramanian et al. (2012) carried out a study in which they studied the relationship \nbetween board independen ce and firm performance  of Indian companies . The outcomes of the study \nindicated that the presence of independent directors on boards did not have a significant impact on the \noverall performance of the companies, as measured by Tobin's Q, return on assets,  and return on equity. \nThese metrics were used to make the determination. There is no guarantee that the performance of the \ncompany will be affected by the independence of the board of directors. The researchers looked for \nsufficient evidence to indicate t hat there is a correlation between the two variables that they were \nstudying. It is essential to point out that the vast majority of studies conducted in this area do indicate \na positive correlation between the independence of the board of directors and th e performance of the \ncompany. Despite this, the results of these studies do indicate that a connection between board \nautonomy and company success is not always simple or universal. Despite this, it is essential to keep \nin mind that the vast majority of stu dies conducted in this area of study reveal a positive association \nbetween the autonomy of boards and the performance of the company.  \n  \n33 \n 2.2.3  Impact of Foreign Board Members on Firm Performance   \nForeign directors are o ne form of diversity that might have a n effect on a board. The existence of \nforeign executives on the board can bring innovative ideas and new dimensions to the company \noperations. Research undertaken previously at the national and international levels is covered in the \nfollowing section. The research both confirm and disprove the standard conclusions, so all the \nimportant information is there. The correlation between international board diversity and corporate \nsuccess has been the subject of extensive research. Research conducted by Gupta and Balasubramanian \n(2019), titled \"Board Internationalization and Performance of Emerging Market Firms: Evidence from \nIndia,\" examined company success and  diverse  board members on the basis of foreign directors  and \nthe success of Indian businesses. The study found that companies with foreign  directors on their boards \nperformed better than those without. \"Foreign Board Membership and Firm Performance: Evidence \nfrom UK Listed Firms\" by Liu and Li (2019) investigates the effect of  foreign board members and the \nsuccess of UK -listed companies. Researchers found a favorable association of having \nhigher  percentage of foreign members on regulatory boards and company efficiency, with the \ncorrelation being stronger for more internationally successful firms. Jing et al. ( 2017) investigated how \nhaving international representation on corporate boards affected the success of Canadian businesses. \nIn addition to finding a positive impact of the  presence of foreign directors on boards and company \noutput, the researchers also fou nd that this correlation was stronger for organizations with a higher \ndegree of internationalization.  \nIn their 2017 article, Pedersen and Ulltveit -Moe looked into how having foreign board members \naffected the success of Norwegian businesses. The researcher s found that companies with higher levels \nof international competition benefited more from having a greater proportion of foreign directors on \ncompany boards. The correlation between having international representation on a company's board \nand financial su ccess was the subject of a meta -analysis by Zhang et al. (2019). According to the study's \nresults, businesses with more international representation on their boards tend to do better. The study \nalso discovered that this association was stronger for busines ses that were highly internationalized and \noperating in emerging markets. Businesses that promote diversity and inclusion in their executive ranks \nare better able to respond to market shifts and remain competitive. The impact of foreign directors on \nboard monitoring and corporate performance in Chinese listed companies , was studied by Zhou et al. \n(2018). The findings of this study shed light on the importance of a diverse board composition, \nespecially in countries with weaker corporate governance systems. T he board's capacity to oversee \noperations and make strategic choices can be strengthened by include foreign directors with a range of \nexpertise and opinions. The inclusion of non -U.S. citizens on business boards was found to improve \ncorporate governance, w hich in turn boosted the bottom line. The impact was significantly greater in \norganizations with poor corporate governance practices. The impact of foreign directors' experience \non emerging market firm performance was studied and reported by Chen et al. (2 019). This research \nshed light on how having foreign members on a board affects a company's performance in various \nmarkets. In countries with weaker institutions, the positive effect of foreign directors' experience on \nfirm performance was shown to be much  more pronounced. The results indicate that companies in both \ndeveloped and emerging markets may benefit from having foreign directors on their boards.  \n34 \n In 2019, Atanasova et al. investigated how having higher number  of foreign directors influence  the \novera ll performance of companies operating in developed markets. In especially for businesses that \nhad lower levels of institutional development, the addition of foreign directors on boards was found to \nbe associated with higher firm value and better financial performance. This was particularly true for \nmultinational corporations. In addition, Alain and Pigé (2019) gathered evidence from Africa for a \nstudy that focused on foreign directors on boards of companies and its impact on company operational \nefficacy. Th e researchers discovered that there was a favorable impact of internalization  on greater \nlevels of company performance, particularly in businesses that had lower levels of institutional \ndevelopment. According to the findings, the positive effects of having  foreign directors on a company \nmay be especially obvious in nations with less robust institutional frameworks. This is because \ninternational directors are able to provide invaluable counsel and knowledge to businesses as they \nnavigate difficult operating situations.  \nKanno and Shigeyama (2019) and Park et al. (2018) looked into  the effect that foreign directors have \non the performance of companies in a variety of settings. Kanno and Shigeyama concentrated their \nresearch on companies located in Japan, while  Park et al. looked at large family businesses located in \nSouth Korea. In spite of these variations, the inclusion of foreign directors on boards was found to be \nassociated with higher business performance in both of the investigations. Wen et al. (2020) c onducted \na literature study on the topic of foreign directors serving on company boards with the objective of \nsynthesizing the findings of prior studies and providing direction for the conduct of additional research. \nThe researchers discovered that the inc lusion of foreign directors on boards was generally related with \nimproved business performance. However, one of their main findings  was that this associat ion was not \nalways obvious . The effect that foreign directors have on the success of a company can be shaped in \nseveral different ways depending on a variety of factors, including the cultural gap between the home \ncountry and the host country, the type of experience that foreign directors bring to the board, and the \ngovernance structures of the company.  \nBorza and Apostol (2017) investigated the effect of  foreign directors on the overall performance of \nsmall and medium -sized businesses located in different developing economies. According to their \nfindings, having national diversity on board  improved busines s performance. Furthermore, this \nrelationship was stronger for companies that had a high level of internation alization in their operations. \nSimilarly, Vyas and Khatri (2019) focused on same subject  in the context of India, with a particular \nemphasis on the  role that board size plays in moderating that relationship. According to the findings \nof the study, the researchers came across company  performance got improved by having modern \ninternational ideas by foreign directors. Furthermore, they discovered that t his relationship was \nstronger for businesses that had small boards. Rivas and Rodrguez (2017) investigated the connection \nbetwee n internationalization of board  and improved company performance in Latin American \ncountries. According to the outcomes , national diversity brings improved and enhanced profitability to \nthe company. The higher the interna tiona lization, the higher the improvement.  Companies, particularly \nthose with a high degree of internationalization or those operating in nations with sign ificant global \nlinkages, can benefit greatly from the participation of foreign directors on their boards, as they can \nbring valuable knowledge and perspectives to the table.  \n35 \n There are not many studies that specifically examine the influence that foreign di rectors have on the \nperformance of firms in Bangladesh; nevertheless, some research has been done to investigate the \neffects that foreign ownership and board diversity have on the performance of firms in the nation. For \nexample, Islam et al. (2019) investi gated how foreign ownership affected the financial performance of \nbanks in Bangladesh and identified a positive influence of  foreign ownership on  company \nperformance. Similarly, Ahmed and Uddin (2016) explored the similar subject on  non-banking \nenterprises  in Bangladesh and also  discovered an upward correlation between the two variables. They \nfound that foreign ownership has beneficial impact  on both operational  performance and financial \nperformance. In the pharmaceutical business of Bangladesh, Hossain and  Reaz (2019) investigated \nhow the presence of diverse board members, particularly national  diversity, influences the overall \nperformance of a company. They concluded that  having a diverse group of board members has a \nfavorable effect on the performance of the company. Hoque et al. (2018) evaluated the effect of board \ndiversity on firm performance in the banking sector of Bangladesh. They discovered that the presence \nof foreign board members had a favorable impact on the financial performance of banks.  \nAltho ugh the majority of studies point to a favorable connection between the presence of foreign \ndirectors and the performance of companies, some study has indicated that there is no substantial \nconnection between the two. For instance, Kutsuna and Smith (2011)  concluded that there was no \nsignificant influence  of foreign  boards on  the value of the firm  in Japan . Similarly , Shimada and Inoue \n(2015) discovered that there was no  significance of  foreign board on  earnings management in Japanese \ncompanies. According t o the findings of another study carried out in Malaysia by Arshad et al. (2017), \ninternationalization does not bring anything positive to  the occurrence of financial hardship. \nYamamoto and Aydinli (2016) also  investigated the role of foreign board members.  According to \ntheir findings, there was  no meaningful effect of internationalization  on the performance of the \ncompany. However, they did discover that board independence had a favorable impact on business \nperformance. This finding suggests that it is bene ficial for a company to have a board that is \nindependent from management.  \nChen et al. (2018) researched  on Chinese publicly traded companies  to find out the correlation . This \ninvestigation concluded  that there is no  substantial impact on a company's overal l success. However, \nthey did discover that an independent board of directors had a beneficial effect on the performance of \nthe company, which is in line with the findings of Yamamoto and Aydinli (2016). Nhung et al. \n(2017)  specifically explored  how the inv olvement of foreign directors  impacted the overall \nperformance of the company. Again the results showed that there was  no meaningful effect on the \nperformance of the company. A research that was conducted by Gonzalez and Gabrielsson (2018) on \nSwedish busin esses indicated that  foreign board  did not have a significant effect on firm performance. \nHowever, the researchers did find that the impact differed based on the country of the foreign board \nmember. To be more specific, the researchers discovered that the existence  of Nordic foreign board \nmembers had a favorable impact on the performance of the firm, whereas the presence of non -Nordic \nforeign board members had a negative impact on the performance of the firm. According to the results \npresented in the study,  the cultural and institutional differences that exist between the home nation of \na foreign board member and the host country may be a factor in determining the impact that having \nforeign board members has on the overall success of a company.  \n36 \n Li et al. (20 18) looked into the connection between the same subjects  but on the  enterprises that were \nlisted in China. They came to the conclusion that the inclusion of foreign board members did not have \na significant impact on the performance of the firms. The resear chers did remark, however, that the \ninfluence may be different depending on the individual features of the foreign board member. These \nvariables include the person's country as well as their level of skill and experience. Okamuro and \nNishimura (2017) condu cted an empirical study of Japanese companies and came to the conclusion \nthat foreign directors on company boards did not have a major impact on the financial condition or \noperational efficiency  of the companies. According to the conclusions, one possible explanation for \nthis phenomenon is that Japanese companies often have relatively low levels of foreign ownership and \nlittle exposure to the business practices of other countries. They also mentioned that the cultural and \ninstitutional variations that exist  between Japan and other nations could be a factor in assessing the \nimpact that foreign directors have on the performance of a company. Rashid and Ahsan (2016) \nexplored the associations between the composition of Bangladeshi companies' boards of directors and \nthe performance of those companies, including the impact of Bangladesh's increasing number of \nforeign board members. The study confirmed that  the inclusion of foreign board members had no \ndiscernible impact on the performance of firms located in Bangla desh. It is vital to note that the \nmajority of research papers imply that foreign board members have an advantageous impact on \nbusiness performance. This is despite the fact that these studies suggest that the effect of international \nrepresentatives  on bus iness profitability may differ among nations and industries.  \nIn spite of the fact that the results of these studies imply that having a number of foreign directors may \nnot have a major impact on the efficiency of companies, it is essential to keep in mind  that other criteria, \nmay have beneficial effects on the success of the firm. The distinctive cultural and institutional \nbackground of each nation should also be taken into consideration because it is possible that these \nfactors will play a role in shaping  the connection between foreign board members and the success of \nthe company. To have a complete understanding of the impact that foreign board members have on the \nsuccess of a company in a variety of circumstances, additional research is required. Althoug h it is \ngenerally agreed upon in the academic literature that the involvement of foreign board members has \nan encouraging effect on the success of a company, there is still a need for additional research to better \nunderstand the unique contexts in which th e causal link between foreign board members and business \nperformance may differ.   \n37 \n 2.2.4 Impact of Government Board Members on Firm Performance  \nHaving government directors on board may bring significant changes to operational efficacy of the \ncompany. One of  the many aspects of diversity that contribute to the effectiveness of a board is the \ninfluence of its government -appointed executives . In this part, many previous studies that have \ninvestigated this correlation will be analyzed, including the most importa nt findings as well as research \nthat contradicts usual conclusions. Darmadi (2012) explored the link between the two in a sample of \nIndonesian state -owned firms. While there have been few worldwide studies on the topic, this \ninvestigation was one of the fe w that was conducted internationally. The study confirms that \ngovernment ownership and board involvement may bring an adverse effect on the overall efficiency \nof the company, as determined by the return on assets and return on equity. According to the outp uts, \nthere may be a correlation between the meddling of the government in the management of these \ncompanies and their poor performance. In a separate piece of research, Khan et al. (2014) investigated \nboard representation, and business performance in a sel ection of Pakistani companies. According to \nthe market -to-book ratio and Tobin's Q, the researchers came to the conclusion that these aspects had \na detrimental effect on the success of the company. They stated that ineffective governance practices, \nsuch as  political intervention and favoritism in board appointments, may be hurting the efficiency of \nthese companies. Kalyanaraman and Priem (2011) investigated a sample of US enterprises and found \nthat government presence on boards had a negative influence on c ompany success, as measured by \nreturn on assets and Tobin's Q. They made the point that government officials may have different \nincentives and interests than other board members, which may lead to conflicts and make it more \ndifficult to make decisions that  are in the best interest of the organization.  \nLi and Wang (2015) looked at a selection of Chinese companies and discovered that the return on \nassets and return on equity fall drastically when government directors are involved in decision making \ncommittees . They concluded  that the ineffectiveness of these companies could be attributed to political \ninvolvement as well as a lack of independence in the appointment of board members. Mehta and \nNarayanan (2019) investigated a selection of Indian companies and fou nd similar negative results. \nThey suggested that political meddling and a lack of professional experience among members of \ngovernment boards could be to blame for this unfavorable relation. Cai and Sevilir (2012) conducted \nan investigation of a selection o f Chinese companies and discovered deteriorating Tobin's Q, return on \nassets, and return on equity. Johnson et al. (2016) conducted research on a selection of African \nenterprises and came to the conclusion that governmental bodies lower its overall perform ance.  Diverse \npolitical views might be the reason the authors indicated.  \nOn the other hand, Ding et al. (2010) conducted study on a collection of Chinese companies and found \nthat government board members had a positive link with firm performance when evalu ated by return \non equity and return on assets. This was established as a result of the researchers' examination of a \ngroup of Chinese enterprises. They argued that officials of the government should be included on the \nboard since they might be able to prov ide the organization with useful strategic advice and connections.  \n \n \n38 \n In general, the findings of these research suggest that the presence of government representation and \ninvolvement on boards may have a disadvantageous  effect on the performance of compan ies. It is \nimportant to note that these studies were conducted in a wide variety of settings, thus it is possible that \nthey are not directly comparable to one another. In spite of this, they give some evidence that members \nof government boards of directors  may bring negative  effect on the performance of firms in some \nenvironments. The relationship between government al members and the profitability  of a company is \ncomplicated and may be influenced by a number of different factors, including the extent to whi ch the \ngovernment is involved, the institutional setting, and the particular qualities of the company.  \nResearchers Barontini and Bozzi (2011) looked at a sample of Italian companies and found a favorable \nassociation between the presence of government board  involvement and the performance of the \ncompany, as assessed by return on assets and return on equity. They hypothesized that government \nofficials serving on the board could provide the company with useful contacts and resources that would \nbe to its advant age. Brown and Caylor (2006) looked at a sample of US companies and concluded that \nthere was no significant correlation between the participation of government board and the firm \nefficiency . The researchers examined the performance of the company using ret urn on assets, re turn \non equity, and Tobin's Q. When Li and Zhou (2016) researched on  Chinese companies, they found that \nthere was a positive correlation between the two. They put out the idea that members of the government \nboard might have access to resources and networks that are beneficial to the company. In general, the \nfindings of the research point to the possibility that the influence of government board members on \nfirm performance may vary from one country and environment to another.  \nIn a study  on Chinese companies by Wang et al. (2017), the researchers came to the conclusion that \nthere is a positive correlation between the presence of government board members and the success of \nthe company . The performance  was measured by ROA  and ROE . They found that members of the \ngovernment board could provide the company with useful resources and contacts, both of which could \nbe to the company's advantage. Similarly , Chen et al. (2015) investigated a selection of Chinese \npublicly traded companies and discover ed positive association between government directors and \nTobin's Q. They hypothesized that having government officials on the board could offer the company \nwith valuable political contacts as well as knowledge of relevant regulatory requirements.  Again , Chen \nand Yuan (2004) did a study on Chinese listed enterprises and discovered that the presence of \ngovernment board members had a favorable impact on firm performance, as assessed by return on \nassets and Tobin's Q. The researchers concluded that the presence  of government board members was \npositively correlated with firm performance. They put out the idea that members of the government \nboard may provide access to resources and information that could be advantageous to the company.  \nThere does not appear to be  a sufficient amount of research in Bangladesh that investigates the \nconnection between the presence of government -appointed directors on boards and the performance of \nbusinesses. This may be the result of a number of factors, including restricted access t o data, a lack of \ninterest in conducting research, or a little presence of government intervention in the private sector.  \n39 \n Chapter  - 3 \nResearch Design  \nThis chapter discusses the developed hypotheses, associated variables, model specification, sample \ndesign , sources and software for analysis . When conducting statistical hypothesis testing, the null \nhypothesis states  that there lies no connection between  the two variables. H 0 typically denotes the null \nhypothesis. The other hypothesis, on the contrary hand, i s an assumption that contradicts the idea of a \nnull and proposes some connection involving both variables in question. H a is commonly used to \ndenote the alternative hypothesis. The fundamental goal of hypothesis testing is to see if the data \nprovides adequ ate proof to disprove the null hypothesis as false while backing the other hypothesis.  \n3.1 Hypothese s Development  \nBased on the  literature assessm ent by Nazrul Islam (2018), this study proposes several hypotheses on \nthe impact of board composition diversity  on business success. The null argument argues that having \na varied board of directors in terms of gender, autonomy, nationality, and political  governance has no \neffect on company earnings. Each alternative hypothesis proposes a unique null hypothesis.  \nH0: The higher  percentage of F emale Board  Directors has no  association with  company  performance.  \nH1: The higher  percentage of F emale Board  Directors  is associated to higher  company  performance.  \nThe first proposition (H 1) proposes that a correlation exists between the percentage of women on a \nboard of directors and the financial success of the company. The argument is predicated on the idea \nthat boards with a majority of women on them tend to take more calculated risks. H aving women on \nboards has been shown to improve company performance in a variety of countries. Darmadi (2011) \nfound that increasing the number of women on boards improved company performance in Indonesia, \nsuggesting that more diverse boards make better dec isions. Similarly, in the US, Hillman et al. (2000) \ndiscovered an upward trend suggesting that boards  with at least one female director make better \ndecisions and perform better overall.  \nH0: The higher  percentage of Independent  Board  Directors has no  association with  company  performance.  \nH2: The higher  percentage of Independent  Board  Directors  is associated to higher  company  performance.  \nThe second argument (H 2) contends that an autonomous board of directors is associated with better \nfinancial result s for the company. The number of independent directors is a proxy for the board's \nindependence because these directors are charged with making objective, long -term decisions for the \ncompany. Fama and Jensen (1983) bolster the case for board independence by  arguing that non -\nexecutive boards improve company performance. This is supported by the findings of Rezaee et al. \n(2018), who discovered that companies  with a larger proportion of autonomous directors fared better \nfinancially.  \n40 \n H0: The higher  percentage of  Foreign  Board  Directors has no  association with  company  performance.  \nH3: The higher  percentage of Foreign  Board  Directors  is associated to higher  company  performance.  \nThe third approach (H 3) proposes that a company's performance is affected by the inclusion of overseas \ndirectors on the board. While having a foreign director on the board might be beneficial to a company's \ngrowth and expansion, it is not without its risks. One potential proble m is that overseas executives on \nboard  may not be familiar with the local corporate culture. In addition, when people have trouble \ncommunicating with one another, it can slow down and complicate decision making, which can have \na negative impact on the succ ess of a business. However, some research has indicated a positive \ncorrelation between international representation on boards and financial outcomes for companies. For \ninstance, Pedersen (2017) looked at Norwegian businesses and concluded that companies wi th a higher \npercentage  directors from overseas  on their boards performed better. In addition, this correlation \nappears to be even stronger for businesses in sectors with more intense global rivalry.  \nH0: The higher  percentage of Government  Board  Directors has no  association with  company  performance.  \nH4: The higher  percentage of Government  Board  Directors  is associated to higher  company  performance.  \nAccording to the fourth postulate (H 4), there is a connection among the number of government -\nnominated directors and the company's profitability. It is unclear how government -appointed directors \naffect company performance because they are chosen only under limited circumstances. Companies' \nbottom lines in Bangladesh are only mildly affected by the number of directors chosen by the \ngovernment. Yield on assets and yield  on equity were shown to be lower for Chinese enterprises with \ngovernment control and board representation in a study by Li and Wang (2015). Political influence and \nan absence of neutrality in board appointments, the researchers posited, could be to blame for the \nnegative effect, which may impair the efficiency of these enterprises .  \n41 \n 3.2 Variable Definition  \nThe multiple regression analysis being conducted in this study includes two types of variables: \nindependent and dependent variables. The re are 3 models with 3 dependent variable s, 4 independent \nvariables and 5 control variables in this study.  These  variable s have  been selected to  represent the \nfirms' performance in this study. There is a formula used to determine the proportions. Investors, \nfinancial analysts, and other interested parties rely heavily on these parameters when assessing a \ncompany's financial health and profitabilit y. As such, the study intends to look into how distinct \nuncorrelated  factors affect the sample business entities ratios.   \n3.2.1 Dependent Variables  \nFor the purposes of statistical analysis, the phrase \"dependent variable\" refers to the variable that is the  \nfocus of attention and measurement. What this means is that the independent variables have an effect \non the dependent variable, which is the outcome or response. The success of a company is evaluated \nhere using ROA, ROE, and NAV as the parameters that are  dependent. They are useful for gauging a \ncompany's or investment vehicle's overall financial health and performance.  \nDependent Variable (1)  \n1.

Increases in return on assets (ROA) are seen favorably since they \nsuggest that a company is making more money off of its assets.  \nDependent Variable (2)  \n2. ROE  Return on Equity  𝑅𝑂𝐸 =𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠  𝑏𝑒𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑒  𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡  & 𝑇𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠  (𝐸𝐵𝐼𝑇 )\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦  (𝑇𝐸) \nReturn on Equity (ROE) quantifies the rate at which a corporation returns capital to its owners. A \nhigher return on equity (ROE) is viewed as a favorable indicator of the financial condition of an \norganization because it shows that shareholders are receiving a higher return on their equity investment.  \nDependent Variable (3) \n3. NAV Net Asset Value  𝑁𝐴𝑉 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡  (𝑇𝐴)−𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝐿𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠  (𝑇𝐿)\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 \n42 \n The Net Asset Value (NAV) of a firm is its total assets minus its total liabilities, expressed as a per -\nshare value. The NAV of a company is frequently a major factor in its valuation. Investors can have a \nbetter grasp of the fund's or trust's true value a nd the fair market value of a share as a consequence of \nhaving  this information.  \n3.2.2 Independent and Control Variables  \nThere are two types of variables in a scientific study: variables that are independent and those that are \ndependent variables. They are  frequently employed in the practice of hypothesis testing. On the \nopposite end of the spectrum, control variables are those elements of a study that are kept constant so \nthat researchers can draw more reliable conclusions regarding the link between the tw o groups of \nvariables. Any effects of inclusion of diversity on board  on company performance reported in this \nresearch can be attributed to  heterogeneity of board  alone, rather than to other factors that may \npotentially impact performance, because the vari ables used as controls are held constant. What follows \nis an explanation of each variable and how it is determined.  \nIndependent Variable (1)  \nfemdirperc  = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒  𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑛 𝐵𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑟 𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒  (𝐵𝑆) \nDiversity among board members, especially among women, is an essential consideration in auditing \ncorporate boards. The percentage of women on a company's board of directors is one indica tor of \ngender diversity that may be used to investigate the connection between this factor and other \nperformance indicators including profitability, creativity, and social responsibility. To isolate the effect \nof gender diversity on key performance indicat ors, we will treat it as an independent variable, adjusting \nfor other potential influences. This research has the potential to shed light on why inclusion of all \ngenders in corporate leadership is beneficial, and how to best achieve it.  \nIndependent Variabl e (2)  \ninddirperc =  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑛 𝐵𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑟 𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒  (𝐵𝑆) \nIndependent board members, who have no vested interest in the outcome of a vote, can help maintain \nobjectivity and ensure fair voting. Board independence is included as an independent variable in their \nanalysis to look into its connection to firm success. This will allow for analysis of how board \nindependence affects key performance in dicators like financial results, safety, and transparency. The \nstudy hopes to learn useful information about the significance of board independence and the possible \ngains from increased independence in corporate governance by examining this factor.  \n \n43 \n Independent Variable (3)  \ngovdirperc =  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑁𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑛 𝐵𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑟 𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒  (𝐵𝑆) \nThe perception of a firm by the government can influence a corporation’s activities severely . In some \ncases, the government may appoint a board to a firm in order to monitor its activities  and operations \nand ensure that they align with government policies and objectives.  To study the impact of governm ent-\nappointed boards on corporate performance, this factor will be added as an independent variable in the \nanalyses. By including government -appointed boards as an independent variable, the impact of this \nfactor on various performance metrics such as finan cial performance, innovation, and social \nresponsibility can be assessed while controlling for other variables that may also impact performance. \nThis can provide valuable insights into the importance of government influence on corporate \ngovernance and the p otential benefits and drawbacks that can be associated with this type of board \ncomposition.  \nIndependent Variable (4)  \nfordirperc =  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑛  𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑛 𝐵𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠  𝑜𝑟 𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒  (𝐵𝑆) \nThe proportion of the board that is not Bangladeshi is one indicator of the board's diversity relative to \nboards with more board members from Bangladesh. This criterion will be used as a c ontrol in studies \nthat look at how different nationalities affect businesses. Using this method, researchers may examine \nthe effect of a multicultural workforce on several different performance indicators while also taking \ninto account other factors that m ay have an effect. The impact on non -financial performance indicators \nincluding innovation, employee satisfaction, and social responsibility can also be analyzed.  \nControl Variable (1)  \ntato =  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠  (𝑇𝑆)\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠  (𝑇𝐴) \nThe Total Asset Turnover (TATO) is a widely used financial metric that evaluates a company's \ncapacity to produce income from its assets. The TATO formula involves net sales as a percentage of \ntotal assets. This financial ratio being  valuable in assessing a  company's proficiency in utilizing its \nassets to generate income. A higher TATO value suggests that a company is producing more income \nper unit of assets, which is typically viewed as a positive indication of efficiency. Conversely, a lower \nTATO may indic ate that a company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate income.  \n44 \n Control Variable (2)  \nlnta =  𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡−𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚  𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡  (𝑆𝑇𝐴 )+𝐿𝑜𝑛𝑔 −𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑚  𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡  (𝐿𝑇𝐴 ) \nTotal asset value as expressed by its natural logarithmic value amount conveyed  in a firm's balance \nsheet is represented by this variable. Total asset value refers to the sum of a company's short -term and \nlong-term assets, including cash, investments, inventory, property, and equipment. In financial \nanalysis, Total ass et value as expressed by its natural logarithmic value  is often included  as a way to \nnormalize the data and reduce the influence of outliers. Moreover, it can also reveal underlying trends \nor patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent when l ooking at the raw numbers. By \ntaking the logarithm of the data, extreme values are scaled down, making it easier to compare values \nacross different companies or time periods.  \nControl Variable (3)  \nage =  𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠  𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒  𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑠 ℎ𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  \nThe variable referred to as \"age\" in this context represents the length of time that the firm has been in \noperation. This particular variable is valuable as a component of the model for what i s known as the \n\"learning effect \". The learning effect refers to the idea that as firms operate over a longer period of \ntime, they gain experience and knowledge that can help them improve their performance a nd \nefficiency. By incorporating the age variable into the model, a better understanding of how this learning \neffect impacts the performance of the firm  can be gained . Furthermore, age is an important variable to \nconsider when analyzing firm performance as it can provide insights into how established the company \nis within its industry and market. Newer firms may face different challenges and opportunities than \nmore established companies, which can impact their financial performance and overall success.  \nContr ol Variable (4)  \nspon_holding =  𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠  ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑆𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑠\n𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  𝑜𝑓 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 \nThere is a commonly held belief that firms with a greater level of sponsorship ownership tend to \nperform better. This may be because sponsors have a higher level of interest in the operations of the \nfirm and may exert greater control over cost management. Sponsorship ownership refers to the level \nof ownership held by a firm's sponsor or sponsors, who are typically private equity or venture capital \nfirms that invest in the company in exchange for a share of ownership. These sponsors often possess  \nan active contribution  in the management, providing strategic guidance and financial support to help \nthe company grow and succeed. The degree of sponsorship ownership is often divulged  in the notes at \nthe end of  financial statements.  The level of sponsorship ownership influences  the performance of the \nfirm, as sponsors may bring valuable expertise, resources, and networks to the table.  \n45 \n Control Variable (5)  \nbrd_attend =  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑  𝐵𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑀𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐵𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑  𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒  (𝐵𝑆) \nAll publicly traded firms are required by law to provide information on the number and makeup of \ntheir board  executives in the annual filings they file. While the significance of such data to an analysis \nof a company's financial health and performance will vary based on the specifics of the business and \nthe industry in which it operates, it is typically seen as a key component. Investors and other \nstakeholders may also benefit from having access to this data when conside ring the company's long -\nterm prospects.  \n3.3 Model Specification  \nThe major purpose of this report  is to examine the relationship between board diversity and a \ncompany's success. Panel data, as  opposed to a  basic OLS  model, were used to accomplish this in th e \nstudy. Both fixed -effect and random -effect models will be assessed, and the Hausman Specification \nTest will  figure out which one works best. The results of the analysis are presented in the later portions \nof the report. The numerous multiple regression m odels used in this report are listed below.  \nModel 1  \nROA =  α + β 1 * femdirperc  + β 2 * inddirperc  + β 3 * fordir perc + β 4 * govdirperc  + β 5 * lnta + β 6 * age + β 7 * tato \n+  β 8 * spon_holding  + β 9 * brd_attend  + εi,t ……………………………. (1)  \nModel 1 Return on Asset, or ROA, is calculated by dividing an organization's earnings before interest \nand taxes (EBIT) by its total assets. This framework analyzes how gender, independence, nationality, \nand governance diversity on boards affect return on i nvestment. Firm age, natural logarithmic value  of \nasset, total asset turnover, sponsoring holding, and board presence are also employed as control \nvariables. The letter i represents a single company, while the symbol t stands for the passage of time.  \nModel  2 \nROE =  α + β 1 * femdirperc  + β 2 * inddirperc  + β 3 * fordir perc + β 4 * govdirperc  + β 5 * lnta + β 6 * age + β 7 * tato \n+  β 8 * spon_holding  + β 9 * brd_attend + εi,t ………………………… …. (2 ) \nThe second model  is a multiple regression analysis of gender, independence, nationality, and \ngovernance board  diversity on another metric of business success or profitability, Return on \nEquity  or ROE. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is the key metric used for assessing a \ncompany's return on equity (ROE). Th e major purpose of this model is to explore the effects of \ninclusion of diversity on board  variables on return on equity (ROE) for a given firm. This model makes \nuse of the same set of controls as previous ones.  \n46 \n Model 3  \nNAV =  α + β 1 * femdirperc  + β 2 * inddirperc  + β 3 * fordir perc + β 4 * govdirperc  + β 5 * lnta + β 6 * age + β 7 * tato \n+  β 8 * spon_holding  + β 9 * brd_attend + εi,t ………………………… …. (3 ) \nIn Model 3, Net Asset Value  (NAV ) is determined by dividing the net asset (Total Asset deducted by \nTotal Liabi lity) of a firm by its total outstanding shares . The main focus of the last  model comprises \nof the urge to find out the miscellany  of board centered  around  gender characteristics , independence, \nnationality and governance  on the NAV . Other control variables are same as before.  \nAcronym  Elaborated Term  \nROA =  Return on asset  \nROE =  Return on equity  \nNAV =  Net asset value  \nfemdirperc =  Ratio of women as  board of directors  \ninddirperc =  Ratio of outsiders  as board of directors  \nfordirperc =  Ratio of foreigners  as board of directors  \ngovdirperc =  Ratio of government -appointees  as board of directors  \nlnta =  Natural logarithm ic values  of total assets  \nage =  The age of listed companies  \ntato =  Total asset turnover ratio  \nspon_holding =  Proportion  of total outstanding shares owned  by sponsors  \nbrd_attend =  Proportion  of board meeting attended by board members in a year  \n \nThe effect of every uncorrelated variable on the one that is dependent (a company's performance) is \nanalyzed here. The fundamental logarithmic value  of total assets, age, total turnover of assets ratio, \npercentage of female, independent, government, and international directors, percentage of sponsoring \nholdings, and board attendance are just few of the factors included in the study. Taking these factors \ninto account, the study hopes to shed light on how board diversity affects a company's bottom line. The \nfindings of this study can be used to learn if a diverse board of directors actually helps a company do \nbetter as a whol e. \n47 \n 3.4 Sampling Method  \nCollecting all data of all the companies in Bangl adesh will be a hectic and time -consuming \ndevelopment  for sure. Hence, the outline  of a sample is a must. The influence  of diverse  decision -\nmaking committees  on corporation  performance  will be researched based on a sample. Instead of \nanalyzi ng all the indu stries in DSE , this study focuses on the Pharmaceutical s & Chemical Indus try \nand Food & Allied Industry. The sample size comprises 33 companies from the Pharmaceutical & \nChemical Indus try and 21 companies from the Food & Allied  Industry. The study analyzes 11  years \nof data, from 2011 to 2021 . However, due to changes in the financial year and unavailability of some \ncompanies' annual reports for 2011 -2021, some data were omitted from the analysis. The data panel \nwas created by combining the available data for th e selected companies over the 11 -year period.  There \nwill be total 594  observa tions of the 54 companies from two  industries in Bangladesh.  \nTable 1  \nSample Size  \nSelected Industry  No. of Listed \nCompanies  No. of Selected \nCompanies  Number of Years \n(2011 -2021 ) Number of \nObservations  \nFood & Allied  21 21 11 231 \nPharmaceutical & Chemical  34 33 11 363 \nTotal  55 54  594 \nTable 1: Sample Size  \nHere, all the companies  from Food & Allied Industry, total 21 of them,  are enlisted. But from \nPharmaceuticals and Chemicals Industry, two of the listed companies were excluded because of the \nlack of the availability of public data. JMI Hospital Requisite Manufacturing Limited  and Navana \nPharmaceuticals Limited  were publicly listed in Dhaka Stock Exchange in 2022 and hence , their \ncompany data from 2011 to 2021  is not published in the sources. On the other hand, G laxosmithkline \nBangladesh Limited was publicly  listed till 2019 and in 2020, they sold 82% of their shareholding to \nUnilever, a private organization . So, Glaxosmithkline’ s data will be included t ill 2019.  \n3.5 Data Source  \nThe financial data for the workings  happen to be  composed  together from the respective yearly \npublication s of each of the companies. In addition to the specific reports published publicly by the \ncompanies, the researchers have also collected information from various other sources such as the \nSpecial Editions of Monthly Review of DSE,  Lanka -Bangla website, and  Investing.com website. These \nsources were utilized to gather information that was not readily available in the published financial \nstatements . This approach of using multiple  other  sources to gather information helps to ensure the \nreliability of the data.  Furthermore, the researchers have used secondary sources for data collection. \nThis approach is commonly used in research as it saves time and resources. However, it is important \nto ensure that the secondary data is relevant to the research question and th at the sources are reliable. \nIn this study, the researchers have ensured the reliability of the secondary sources by using reputable \nsources and cross -checking the information with other sources to ensure its accuracy.  \n48 \n Table 2  \nSources of Data  \nSource Name  Type of Material  Type of Source  Link \nAnnual Reports  Report  Secondary   \nDhaka Stock Exchange  Website  Secondary  https://www.dsebd.org/   \nLankaBD  Website  Secondary  https://lankabd.com/   \nInvesting.com  Website  Secondary  https://investing.com/   \nTable 2: Sources of Data  \nThese are the reports and websites that were used to gather all the financial data of the sample \ncompanies. All the sources gather secondary data. The links are attached to the table.  \n3.6 Software for Data Analysis  \nIn order to analyze data, conduct preliminary tests, and perform multiple regression in a research to \nevaluate the influence of  having diversity on decision -making committees on company’s overall \ngrowth and success , the software  package  Stata version 15 (Stata15)  was utilized. The first step in \nusing Stata  for analysis will be  to import and prepare the data. The data was in a raw format and needed \nto be cleaned, transformed, and organized in a way that was suitable for analysis. This involved \nremoving missing values, duplicates, and outliers, as well as transforming variables into appropriate \nformats for analysis.  \nThe validity of t he regression model will be checked using a battery of preliminary analyses. These \ntests includes  testing for multicollinearity, autocorrelation and homoscedasticity. Stata’s  built-in \ndiagnostic tools will be  used to perform these tests. If any issues are detected, appropriate modifications \nwill be  made to the regression model to ensure that it is appropriate for the data.  Once the data was \nprepared  and preliminary tests are done and appropriate dataset is selected , the next step is to conduct \nregression an alysis. Stata’s  regression capabilities will be  used to model the relationship between peer \npressure and capital structure. Steps in this process include articulating the connection between \nvariables that are both independent and dependent, settling on a suitable regression model, and \ncalculating estimates for the coefficients. Stata’s  graphical capabilities will also  create vi sual \nrepresentations of the data and the results. This made it easy to interpret the results and understand the \nrelationship between peer pressure and capital structure.  \n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n Chapter - 4 \nEmpirical Analysis  \nIn order to figure out the link among both the dependent and the independent variables, this report  will \ncreate a few tests in this chapter. Before running the multiple regression, the preliminary tests, \ndescriptive analysis and ratio analysis will be conducted to continue the analysis with more precis ion \nand depth.  \n4.1 Descriptive Analysis  \nStatistics used for describing data include averages, extremes, medians, and ranges as well as \ndispersion measurements like standard deviation and counts. The Mean is used to define  the midpoint \nof a group of numbers . Each value's standard deviation from the mean is measured by this statistic. \nThe greater the standard deviation, the more dissimilar the values are from the mean and the less \npredictable they are. The lowest possible number in the dataset  displays the lo west possible value for \nthe variable, and the largest number in the dataset  displays the greatest possible value for the variable.  \nTable 3  \nDescriptive Statistics  \nVariable  Unit Observation  Mean  Std.

The \nstudy analyzed the ROA, ROE and NAV  as the dependent variable s to denote the firms' performance. \nThe variables are  calculated using a specific formula  described in the previous chapter (Chapter – 3, \nResearch Design) . The study focused on 54 companies under the Food & A llied and Pharmaceutic als \n& Chemicals I ndustries for the last 11 years (2011 -2021), and the mean  ROA was approximately \n0.0069 with a deviation of 0.25 and highest figure  of 0.6 6. The average ROA should have been around  \n0.05, so the average value is very poor considering the standard value.  But it should also be mentioned \nthat Food and Pharmaceuticals Industries are not something that anticipate higher margin, rather they \nprofit very low. The average ROE is -0.9750 with a deviation of 28.55 and maximum value of 31.58 . \nThe average NAV is 46.38  million  per share with a deviation of 218.75 mn and maximum value of \n2,121.81 mn.  \nThere are a maximum of 67% women on the board, which has an average of 15.22% female directors. \nThis number can go as high as 67%.  On average, there are 19.43% directors that are from outside and \nare independent out of a total of board members, with a maximum of 67% autonomous  directors \nserving as the decision -making committee . On average, there are only 2.58% of directors from other \ncountries on board, and the number of overseas  directors can reach a maximum of 57%. Last but not \nleast, the average number of government directors serving on the executive committee  is only 1.88%, \nwhile the maximum number of government members serving as decision makers  is 50%. These \nfindings shed light on the make -up of the boards of directors as well as their influence on the operations \nof the companies.  \nMoreover, the average total assets for these companies were approximate ly BDT 5,565 million, with \na deviation of 11652 million. The total asset ranges from 59 million to 86,602 million in Food and \nPharmaceuticals industry in Bangladesh. Total asset turnover ratio shows how efficiently companies \nis using its assets to generate  revenue.  The average total asset turnover ratio of 0.6399 indicates that \nthe companies are generating approximately 64 cents of revenue for every dollar of assets it owns. A \nlow total asset turnover ratio could be an indication that the company's assets a re not being used \neffectively to generate sales, or that the company is carrying too many assets that are not being used \nefficiently.  The age represents here the running years of operation of the companies in Food & Allied \nand Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals  Industry. The average running years is 37 years with minimum of \n8 years and maximum of 116 years of operation.  \nThe investigation also revealed that, on  average, sponsors control 34.01%  of the company they are \ninvesting in  with the deviation of 0.2561 . The average attendance in annual board meetings are 85.43% \nwhich is pretty high and satisfactory attendance by the board members. The deviation is 4.0895  and \nthe attendance ranges from 30% to 100% in boards meetings.   \nThe descriptive statistics show the exist ing condition of the firm performance metrics, percentage of \nboard diversity, total asset, running years, percentage of sponsoring ownership and attendance of board \nof directors in board meetings.  \n \n  \n51 \n 4.2 Preliminary Tests  \nPreliminary tests can help ful to  identify and deal with multiple potential problems and address them \nbefore fitting the model. In this report, multicollinearity , autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity  issue  will \nbe checked through Pearson Correlation, Wooldrigde Test and Breusch -Pagan Test respectively .  \n4.2.1 Multicollinearity Test - Pearson Correlation  \nThe magnitude as well as the trend of the linear connection between both factors can be assessed with \nthe help of the Pearson correlation. The degree of association between two or more  indep endent factors \nis a common test in statistical analysis. Here, we are interested in the degree of association between \nthe many independent factors. There is a higher chance that the regression findings will be off if there \nis a lot of overlap between the i ndependent variables. The coefficient can take on values between -1 \nand +1, with -1 denoting a perfectly  inverse correlation, +1 a perfectly  positive in order one, and 0 \nindicating no association at all. For assessing the Pearson correlation coefficient,  the product of the \ntwo variables' standard deviations are taken  and the value is  split by their covariance. If the coefficient \nis less than 0.80, then the independent variables are not correlated, thus multicollinearity is not a \nconcern. However, if the coe fficient is more than 0.80, there is a multicollinearity problem in the \ndataset that must be addressed by excluding the correlated variables from further analysis.  \nThe following table is the output of Pearson Correlation of the dataset where the independe nt variables \nare femdirperc  (Ratio of women as  directors ), inddirperc  (Ratio of independent member of board ), \nfordirperc  (Ratio  of foreign directors), govdirperc  (Percentage of government directors), tato (Total \nasset turnover ratio), lnta (Natural logarit hm of total assets), age (Years of running operation), \nspon_holding  (Percentage of sponsoring holding) and brd_attend  (Percentage of board attendance in \nannual meetings).  \nTable 4  \nPearson Correlation  \n femdirperc  inddirperc  fordirperc  govdirperc  tato lnta age spon_holding  brd_attend  \nfemdirperc  1.0000          \ninddirperc  0.1836  1.0000         \nfordirperc  0.0057  0.1139  1.0000        \ngovdirperc  -0.0106  0.0107  0.1242  1.0000       \ntato 0.0952  0.1618  0.3673  0.1034  1.0000      \nlnta 0.1092  0.1226  0.0356  0.3113  0.0354  1.0000     \nage -0.0377  -0.0645  0.1899  0.2999  0.1821  0.3714  1.0000    \nspon_holding  0.3385  0.2000  0.3351  -0.0944  0.4600  0.0103  0.1068  1.0000   \nbrd_attend  -0.0094  0.0410  -0.0127  -0.0048  0.0009  0.0007  0.0155  0.0363  1.0000  \nThe results show that n one of the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.80. The highest coefficient is \n0.4600 between tato and spon_holding which is way lower than 0.80. S o, it can be concluded that  all \nof the variables can be utilized as input in the regression analysis bec ause there does not exist the \ndependency issue as multicollinearity.  \n52 \n 4.2.2 Multicollinearity Test - Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)  \nAnother measure that can be used in regression analysis to evaluate the extent of multicollinearity  \nbetween predictor variables is called the Variance Inflation Factor, also referred to as or VIF. VIF  is \nestablished by comparing the variance of the anticipated  predictive estimate of a certain predictor \nvariable to the variance of the same coefficient wh en that predictor variable is not included in the \nequation. The ratio that results from this comparison is the VIF. If the VIF for a given predictor variable \nis larger than 5 or 10, then it is regarded as having a high level of significance. If this is the  case, it \nsuggests that the estimated regression coefficient for that variable has an inflated standard deviation \ndue to its level of multicollinearity with other predictor variables in the model. In this scenario, it is \npossible that it is required to con sider eliminating the variable or finding strategies to lower the overall \nlevel of interdependence in the model, such as by combining or converting variables or gathering \nadditional data. Alternatively, it may be necessary to consider removing the variable . The VIF is a \nhelpful diagnostic tool that can be used to assess the validity of an analysis of regression and the \nassumptions it makes. The VIF result of the dataset is presented in the table that can be found below.  \nTable 5  \nVIF Test  \n \nThe VIF test shows  that the factor consistently falls in the range of 1.02 to 1.59. Therefore, neither 10 \nnor 5 is a factor. This strongly suggests that the independent variables in hypotheses  do not exhibit \nmulticollinearity. Once again, it confirms that there is no interd ependence  among  all of the independent \nvariables and that all of them can be used in the multiple regression examination.  \n  \n    Mean VIF        1.26                                      brd_attend        1.01    0.994980  inddirperc        1.11    0.901330  femdirperc        1.20    0.836684  govdirperc        1.21    0.823573  fordirperc        1.26    0.794665          ta        1.28    0.779741         age        1.31    0.760651        tato        1.40    0.711888spon_holding        1.59    0.630864                                        Variable         VIF       1/VIF  \n53 \n 4.2.3 Autocorrelation T est \nAutocorrelation quantifies how closely the values of a variable are associated with each other over \ntime.  Autocorrelation is also referred to as serial correlation, as it measures the correlation of a variable \nwith a delayed version of itself. Specifically, autocorrelation examines the magnitude and direction of \nthe linear connection between a variable and it s delayed values. The dataset will derive wrong \ninformation if there is autocorrelation issue with the variables  as the assumption of independence of \nvalues is violated . Therefore, the problem must be resolved before it is possible to identify the linkage \namong the  variables that are dependent and independent.  \nBreusch -Godfrey Test as a type of  Lagrange Multi plier T est (LM Test) and Wooldridge T est are widely \nused in academics  to evaluate  validity of linear regression models, and they can help identify potential \nserial correlation problems with the models that need to be addressed in order to obtain more accurate \nand reliable results.  In Model 1,  2 and 3, both Breusch Godfrey LM Test and W ooldridge Test will be \napplied to detect if there is any autocorrelation problem within the dataset.  It should also be mentioned \nthat if the tests provide opposite results, Wooldridge Test will be considered as the more reliable one \nto research further int o the subject.  \nBoth Breusch -Godfrey LM Test and Wooldridge Tests were run for the three models. Both tests \nprovided opposite results in all the models. The test results of Breusch -Godfrey LM Test will be \nprovided in the appendix (Appendix 4 ). So, the resul ts of Wooldridge Test will be considered as the \nfinal output.  \nThe following Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8  derives the Wooldridge Test results for all the three models \nin this report  respectively.  \nTable 6 : Model 1  \nAutocorrelation Test  \n(Wooldridge  Test) \nWooldridge test for autocorrelation  in panel data  \nF-Statistic  Prob > F  \n0.435 0.5123 \nH0: There is no  concern for  serial correlation.  \nHa: There is concern for serial correlation.  \nThe significance level of F for the Wooldridge Test is 0.435, and the p -value for rejecting the concept \nof null  is 0.5123,  the latter being more than 0.05, therefore  the possibility of serial correlation cannot \nbe ruled out  in the data. It states  that Mode l 1 has no concerns with autocorrelation.   \n54 \n Table 7 : Model 2  \nAutocorrelation Test  \n(Wooldridge  Test) \nWooldridge test for autocorrelation  in panel data  \nF-Statistic  Prob > F  \n38.673 0.0000 \nThe Wooldridge Test for the 2nd model has  uncovered serial correlation, with a the F -coefficient of \n38.673 and a statistical significance level of 0.0000, which is less than 0.05, ruling out the possibility \nof a false positive result. Which means this model comprises of autocorrelation issue and this has to be \nresolved before continuing for further analysis.  \nTable 8 : Model 3  \nAutocorrelation Test  \n(Wooldridge  Test) \nWooldridge test for autocorrelation  in panel data  \nF-Statistic  Prob > F  \n53.093 0.0000 \nThe third and last model runs the Woolridge Test where the significance level of F -statistic is 53.093, \nand the significance level of p is again 0.0000 and  less than 0.05, so the possibility of an autocorrelation \nproblem in the numbers cannot be ruled out  and reject the null hypothesis. Errors in Model 3 show \nsigns of autocorrelation; this issue must be fixed before proceeding with regression analysis.  \n4.2.4 Heteroscedasticity T est \nStatistically, \"heteroscedasticity\" signifies the situation in which a variable's variability varies among \nits possible values. This in dicates a change in the variance of the variable as a function of the value of \nthe independent variable. Particularly in regression analysis, heteroscedasticity can cause inaccurate \ninferences about the statistically importance  of the projected consequence s and inaccurate, wasteful \nparameter estimations. Formally recognizing heteroscedasticity can be done with certain statistical \ntests as the Breusch -Pagan test or the White test.  \nTransforming the variables or employing a weighted least squares regression ar e two options for \ndealing with heteroscedasticity. Logarithmic and square root transformations are two common methods \nof variable transformation.  \nIf there is a heteroscedasticity issue in the dataset, the Breusch -Pagan Test will be used to identify it. \nThe outcomes of the Breusch -Pagan test are tabulated in Tables 9, Tab le 10, and Table 11  below, for \nthe three models analyzed here . \n \n55 \n Table 9 : Model 1  \nHeteroscedasticity  Test \n(Breusch -Pagan  Test) \nBreusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity  \nChi2 (1) Prob > Chi2   \n638.58 0.0000 \nH0: The variances are constant.  \nHa: There is heteroscedasticity problem.  \nAccording to Breusch -Pagan Test for Model 1, the Chi2 value is 638.58 and the significance level of p \nis 0.0000 and  less than 0.05, so the possibility of the intermittent variances  in the numbers cannot be \nruled out  as well the idea of not having heteroscedasticit y problem in the dataset . So, it should be \nmentioned  that there is evidence o f heteroscedasticity problem in Model 1 and it should be addressed \nand re solved for further regression analysis.  \nTable 10 : Model 2  \nHeteroscedasticity  Test \n(Breusch -Pagan  Test) \nBreusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity  \nChi2 (1)  Prob > Chi2   \n1845.58 0.0000 \nIn Model 2 Breusch -Pagan Test, the Chi2 value is 1845.58 and the significance level of p is again below  \n0.05, so the possibility of the intermittent variances  in the numbers cannot be ruled out  as well the idea \nof not having heteroscedasticity problem in the dataset. So, there is evidence o f heteroscedasticity \nprobl em in Model 2 as well and it should be resolved before next step.  \nTable 11 : Model 3  \nHeteroscedasticity  Test \n(Breusch -Pagan  Test) \nBreusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity  \nChi2 (1)  Prob > Chi2   \n560.25 0.0000 \nAccording to Breusch -Pagan Test in Model 3, the  Chi2 value is 560.25 and the significance level of p \nis again less than 0.05, so the possibility of the intermittent variances  in the numbers cannot be ruled \nout. So, it should be mentioned that there is evidence o f heteroscedasticity  problem in Model 3 and it \nshould be addressed and resolved for further regression analysis.  \n56 \n 4.2.5 Hausman T est \nBy comparing the variance in the predicted coefficients of the two models, the Hausman test provides \nan analytical tool for distinguishing betwe en using fixed and random effects. Fixed effects are \npreferable in terms of efficiency and consistency if the difference is statistically significant. There is \nno need to use random effects if the difference is not statistically significant because they ar e more \nadaptable and provide more leeway for inference. Panel data analysis requires a model that strikes a \nbalance between efficiency and flexibility; this test might help you choose the right one.  \nFixed Effect:  In order to account for unobserved heteroge neity, statistical models sometimes \nincorporate individual -specific effects known as \"fixed effects.\" In econometrics, panel data analysis \nfrequently makes use of fixed effects to account for the impact of constant individual -level features \nacross observat ions. These effects are supposed to be correlated with the independent variables in the \nmodel and are treated as estimating parameters in a fixed effects model. In order to more precisely \nestimate the impact of the independent variables, the model might us e fixed effects to take into account \nthe unobserved heterogeneity that is unique to each person. Time -invariant variables that could provide \nbiased or inconsistent estimates if left out of the model are a prime example of when fixed effects \nmodels shine.  \nRandom Effect:  In statistical modeling, the term \"random effect\" is used to describe the distribution \nof unnoticed variation in the population. In econometrics, panel data analysis frequently makes use of \nrandom effects in order to model the influence of s hared, time -invariant factors among study \nparticipants. The assumption of independence among the independent variables allows the variance \nthat is not observed to be treated as a random variable in a random effects model. Accurate estimates \nof the impact o f the independent variables are possible because random effects allow the model to take \ninto account the unforeseen variability that is shared across all individuals. Because they are more \nadaptable in the face of changing circumstances or smaller sample s izes, random effects models are \npreferable to their fixed effects counterparts.  \nIf the  dataset and some variables are unconfirmed of  whether to be  used a fixed effect or a random \neffect to analyze it, the Hausman Test is an excellent tool to use. Appendix  8 displays the fixed effect \noutput, while Appendix 9  displays the random effect output. One possible hypothesis for using in the \nHausman Test is as follows:  \nH0: Random Effect  model is suitable.  \nH1: Fixed Effect  model is suitable.  \nThe null hypothesis will be rejected and the fixed effect model will be utilized for regression analysis \nif the probability value is less than 0.05, indicating that the test results are significant. Regression \nanalysis should use a random effect model if the p -value indicates that  the test findings are not \nsignificant,  if it is exceeding 0.05. The  outcomes of the Hausman Test for the three models will be \ndiscussed below respectively.  \n  \n57 \n Table 12   \nHausman Test  \nModel 1  \nChi2 (7) Prob > Chi2   \n16.15 0.0238 \nAccording to Hausman  Test in Model 1, the Chi2 value is 16.15 and the significance value is 0.0238 \nwhich is below  0.05, so the null assumption  is to be rejected . So, the Fixed Effect Model will be used \nfor analyzing Model 1. It is also to be mentioned that Model 1 consists of  heteroscedasticity issue but \nno concerns for  serial correlation problem  is here . So, Robust Regression in Fixed Effect will be \nfinalized for  Model 1  analysis.  \nTable 13  \nHausman Test  \nModel 2  \nChi2 (7) Prob > Chi2   \n1.32 0.9879 \nAccording to Hausman Test  in Model 2 , the Chi2 value is 1.32 and the significance value is 0.9879  \nwhich is higher  than 0.05, so the null assumption  cannot  be rejected  which postulates that the Random \nEffect Model is appropriate for regression analysis . So, the Random  Effect Model will be suitable  for \nanalyzing the second Model . It should also be added  that Model 2  consists of both heteroscedasticity \nand auto correlation concerns . So, Feasible Generalized Least Squared Regression Model (FGLS)  will \nbe finalized for Model  2. \nTable 14  \nHausman Test  \nModel 3  \nChi2 (7) Prob > Chi2   \n6.78 0.4525 \nIn Model 3 Hausman Test , the Chi2 value is 6.78 and the significance value is 0.4525  which is again \nhigher  than 0.05, so the null assumption  is failed to be rejected which postulates that the Random Effect \nis suitable  for regression analysis. So, the test suggests that Random  Effect Model to be used  for \nanalyzing Model 3 . But m oreover, it should be added that Model 3  consists of both heteroscedasticity \nand serial correlation problem. So, again Feasible Generalized Regression Model (FGLS)  will be fitted \nfor analysis  of Model 3 . \n \n  \n58 \n 4.2.6 Summary of Preliminary Test  \nThe table below summarizes the results of all the preliminary tests that have been run to eli minate any \nissue within the dataset and derive more precise results from the regression analysis.  \nTable 15  \nSummary of Preliminary Test Results  \n Multicollinearity  Autocorrelation  Heteroscedasticity  Hausman Test  Preferred Model  \nModel 1  No No Yes Fixed Effect  Fixed Effect \n(Robust)  \nModel 2  No Yes Yes Random Effect  FGLS Model  \nModel 3  No Yes Yes Random Effect  FGLS Model  \nAccording to the preliminary tests, there is no multicollinearity issue wit hin the independent variables \nin the model s. As per autocorrelation, Model 1 is free of such issue, but Model 2 and Model 3 have \nfirst-order serial correlation problem within the values. As per heteroscedasticity, all the three models \nhave heteroscedasticit y problem in them pointing their  variances  are not constant. When a dataset faces \nsuch issues, it should be resolved before running any regression otherwise they will derive faulty results \nand inaccurate observations. Moreover, the Hausman Test suggested  Fixed Effect to be fitting  for \nModel 1 and Random Effect will be suitable  for Model 2 and Model 3. So , in the end, Robust \nRegression in Fixed Effect  will be suitable for Model 1 as it will eliminate t he heteroscedasticity  issue. \nBesides, Feasible Generalized Least Squared (FGLS) Model is very suitable in eliminating both \nheteroscedasticity and first -order autocorrelation. So, FGLS Model will be most preferred model for \nModel 2 and Model 3.   \n  \n59 \n 4.3 Multiple Regression   \nThe following part showcases the main regression results of the three models in this work . Here the \ntotal number of observations is 594 in each case. The total number of observations have been divided \ninto 54 groups where the number of observation per group is  11.  \nTable 1 6 presents the outcome of Model 1  that has the same independent variables as mentioned before \nand takes ROA as a dependent variable.  The Hausman Test suggested Fixed Effect Model to be run \nand for heteroscedasticity issue, Robust  standard errors were estimated. According to the St ata \noutcomes presented in Table 1 6, the probability of F -value  is 0.0000 which is significant at 1% level \nmeaning that this is a highly significant, appropriate and nicely fitted model and coefficient is not equal \nto 0. The within R -squared value of 8.10% depicts the variability of the variable within each group. \nThe between R -squared value of 0.24% depicts the variability the between dependent variables. The \noverall R -squared value is 1.20% that depicts t he variation of the variables.  \nThe value of sigma u depicts that the standard deviation of residuals within groups is 22.96%. The \nvalue of sigma e depicts that the standard deviation of residuals of overall error terms is 10.80%. The \nvalue of rho depicts t hat 81.88% of the disparity  is because of the  differences across panels.  \nTable 16  \nModel 1 (ROA)  \nFixed Effect Model (Robust)  \n \nHere , the constan t term has a value of -0.03367 and is significant at 5 % significance level. Other \nvariables like inddirperc, brd_attend and spon_holding are also significant at 5 %, 5%  and 10% \nsignificance  level  respectively . If everything else remain constant, for 1 unit upturn  in inddirperc , ROA \nwill de crease by 0.2765 unit , for 1 unit upturn  in brd_attend , ROA will increase by  0.0958 unit  and for \n1 unit increase in spon_holding , ROA will escalate  by 0.0601 unit .  \n                                                                                       rho    .81880158   (fraction of variance due to u_i)     sigma_e    .10802122     sigma_u    .22962608                                                                                     _cons    -.0336779   .0129293    -2.60   0.012    -.0596108    -.007745  brd_attend     .0958766   .0386076     2.48   0.016     .0184395    .1733137spon_holding     .0601453    .033164     1.81   0.075    -.0063732    .1266638         age            0  (omitted)        lnta     4.32e-07   8.91e-07     0.49   0.630    -1.35e-06    2.22e-06        tato     .0348298   .0266723     1.31   0.197    -.0186681    .0883277  govdirperc     .1076196   .0880274     1.22   0.227     -.068941    .2841803  fordirperc    -.0785498   .2243432    -0.35   0.728    -.5285252    .3714255  inddirperc    -.2765448    .121451    -2.28   0.027    -.5201446   -.0329451  femdirperc    -.1105683   .0694684    -1.59   0.117    -.2499043    .0287677                                                                                       ROA        Coef.

Whereas govdirperc, tato, lnta, spon_holding and brd_attend have coefficient of \n0.1076, 0.0348, 0.0432, 0.0601 and 0.0958 respectively  which means these variables have positive  \nimpact on ROA . The variable age has been omitted by the system  because of collinearity issue. Again, \nfemdirperc , fordirperc, govdirperc, tato, lnta , spon_holding, and brd_attend – none of these variables \nare significant.  \nTable 1 7 presents the regression output of Model 2 that has the same independent variables as \nmentioned before and takes ROE as a dependent varia ble. Though Hausman Test suggested Random \nEffect for Model 2, b ecause of having both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation problem, Feasible \nGeneralized Least Squared (FGLS) Model is more appropriate for Model 2. According to the Stata \noutcomes presented in Table 17, the probability of z -value is 0.0000 which is significant at 1% level \nmeaning that this is a highly significant, appropriate and nicely fitted model.  \nTable 17  \nModel 2 (ROE)  \nFeasible Generalized Least Squared Model  \n \nAs per the p -value of the FGLS  model, the constan t term has a value of -1.6976  and is not significant. \nOther variables like govdirperc  has negative correlation , lnta and brd_attend have positive correlation \nand they are significant at 1% level of significance . If everything else remain constant, for 1 unit \nincrease  in govdirperc , ROE will de crease by 4.8438  unit, for 1 unit rise in lnta, ROE will increase by \n0.000153  unit and for 1 unit rise in brd_attend, ROE will escalate  by 2.9675  unit.  \nAll the other variabl es such as f emdirperc, inddirperc , fordirperc , tato, age and spon_holding are \nnegatively related with ROE and are insignificant.   \nTable 1 8 presents the regression output of Model 3 that has the same independent variables as \nmentioned before and takes NAV a s a dependent variable. Here again, Hausman Test suggested \nRandom Effect for Model 3, but because of having both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation \nproblem, again FGLS Model is more appropriate for Model 3.

In addition, \nthe femdirperc and govdirperc variables are significant at the 1% level, but the lnta, spon_holding, and \nbrd_attend variables are significant at the 5% level.

As previously several researches suggested to have a board as diverse as possible, here, \nconsidering Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals and Food & Allied industries in Bangladesh, showing some \ndissimilar results. The diversity was supposed to improve the performance not deteriorate it.

Where it was expected that the ratio \nof having women , independent and foreign decision makers  on the board  were supposed to be upward \ntrending  with higher business profitability  and the ratio of government -appointed  executives for major \ndecision -making  on the board was supposed to  have downward turning  correlation with company  \nperformance, the reality discloses that only the variable of the ratio of government decisi on-making \nexecutives  has the correct sign.  Moreover, not all the independent variables does not actually have \nsignificant correlation  with firm efficiency  in Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals Industry and Food & \nAllied Industry in Bangladesh.  \nThe ratio of the specific board directors were the core independent variables in the study. So, the \nimpression  of these four variables will be focused on in findings. The proportion of foreign decision \nmakers on board  has no significant correlation with firm performance in any model. The ratio of female \ndirectors on the board has significant correlation with NAV but with wrong sign. The ratio of \n65 \n independent and outside directors  on executive committee  has significant c orrelation with ROA only, \nbut having the wrong sign. The ratio of government -appointed  directors has significant correlation with \nROE with correct sign and with NAV with wrong sign. Besides, Total Asset Turnover Ratio and \nNatural Logarithm of Total Asset b eing very close to each other, Total asset turnover ratio has no \nsubstantial  impact on business  efficacy  and whereas natural logarithm ic value  of total asset is \nsignificantly related with ROE and NAV with positive signs. Age is an insignificant variable in  all \nmodels. Sponsor Ownership has significant relation with ROA and NAV with positively signs. Lastly, \nBoard Attendance is significant in all models with 5% to 10% significance level.  \nModel 1  estimated r egression  results depict that the ratio of Independe nt and Outside Directors on the \nboard, Sponsoring Ownership and Board Attendance reject the null hypothesis and establish affiliation  \nwith business  earnings  (ROA). Where the expected signs were all positive, the output shows only \nsponsoring ownership and b oard attendance had positive signs and the ratio of those outside and \nautonomous  directors had the opposite impact on company success . \nModel 2  estimated r egression  results depict that the ratio of Government Board Directors, Natural \nLogarithm ic Value  of To tal Asset and Board Attendance reject the null hypothesis with 1% \nsignificance level and establish relationship with firm performance (ROE). The expected signs were \nnegative for proportion of government directors  and positive for total asset and board atte ndance , and \nthe result shows evidence that all the three variables have the correct signs and have  impact on firm \nperformance.  \nModel 3  estimated r egression  results depict that the ratio of Female decision -makers  on the board, the \nratio of Government Directors, Natural Logarithm ic Value  of Total Asset, Sponsoring Ownership and \nBoard Attendance reject the null hypothesis and establish association  with business success  (NAV). \nThe expected signs were positive for the proportion of female di rectors, total asset, sponsoring holding \nand board attendance; and negative for the ratio of government directors. The output shows evidence \nthat ratio of female decision -makers , total asset and board attendance have correct signs meaning that \nthey have po sitive impression  on business success . But the ratio of government board directors and \nsponsoring ownership have wrong signs proving that they had the opposite effect  on business earnings \nand performance (NAV).  \nThe estimated outputs discover  evidence that the diversity on board is not always beneficial for better \nfirm performance. A few of them can have significant impact. In case of Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals \nIndustry and Food & Allied Industry in Bangladesh, the diversity rather has negative impact on fi rm \nperformance as they bring rather deterioration to returns. But higher attendance in board meetings \ndefinitely bring higher returns to the firms.  \n  \n66 \n 4.5 Suggestions  \nThis analysis revealed many aspects relating to the structure of board in Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals \nand Food & Allied industry in Bangladesh. These specific industries do not operate like the others, \nespecially in the context of Bangladesh. So, the following suggestions are solely based on this analysis:  \n1. Not all kind of diversity can be benef icial for the company. Where it was expected to have \nmore benefits from gender or national diversity on decision making committees, the actual \nresults show the opposite. So, having independent, female or foreign board directors bring \ninverse effect on the success. The board should consist of enough number of members, but \nhaving all kind of diversity would not be wise. One or two kind may bring difference but more \nmay bring more disputes, unwise decisions, urge to show power which can increase expenses \nto resolve these and eventually decrease profitability.  \n2. The attendance in board meetings contribute mostly in all business performance metrics. So, it \nis an effective functioning of the board, as it ensures that all members are present to participate \nin discuss ions, make decisions, and provide oversight that eventually helps business success. \nA low attendance rate may lead to a lack of quorum, which can prevent the board from making \nimportant decisions or taking action on critical matters. In Bangladeshi context , board \nattendance proved to be most significant for higher performance.  \n3. Sometimes, appointing government executives to the board may bring upward growth to the \nbusiness earnings where it was supposed to bring decrease in performance. So, before \nrestrainin g government directors, the benefits the company will get should be considered.  \n4. If diverse people are included on the board, they should be trained, experienced, qualified and \nwise to take any decision instantly, not just because they have to be included a s a part of the \nboard.  \nPharmaceuticals & Chemicals and Food & Allied industry in Bangladesh operate very differently than \nother industries and so the distinct suggestion and process for appointing board members. This report \ntried to contribute to the spec ific sectors in Bangladesh, so that a clear view can be presented on how \nboard diversity works on these industries.  \n  \n67 \n Chapter – 5 \nSummary and Conclusion  \nThis chapter summarizes the subject of this report  and provides a conclusion of the whole report. The \nreport analyzed multiple models to establish the link between diverse board and firm performance.  \n5.1 Summary  \nThe summary of the report  is provided below. The first chapter introduces Board Diversity and its \nimpact on the firm performance  and the necessity of this research in the context of Bangladesh. A \ndiverse board can help bring different skillset, knowledge and experience to the board. Despite having \na great importance in improving performance, Bangladesh has limited published materia ls on board \ndiversity. The main objective  of this report  was to find the effect of diverse board on firm performance  \nin Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals Industry and Food and Allied Industry in Bangladesh .  \nChapter 2 deals with  the theoretical aspects and previous studies related to board diversity. Boardroom \nReview,  a continuous process of determining corporate goals, internal and external review and \ndeveloping an implementation program, monitors a board regularly. The other th eories such as Agency \nTheory,  Upper Echelon Theory, Stakeholder Theory, Critical Mass Theory, Institutional Theory, \nResource Dependence Theory and Social Identity Theory  describes the relationship between owner -\nmanager, top management, minor and other stak eholders and available outside resources of the \ncompany . Alongside the established theories , this chapter discusses previous literatures on this subject. \nMany published researches have concluded that board diversity helps to perform better. The majority \nof the articles described that inclusion of female, independent foreign directors positively affect the \nperformance and government directors negatively affect the performance.  But opposite conclusions \nhave also be seen in some studies.  \nIn Chapter 3, a resear ch design is  developed to conduct the empirical analysis. T hree dependent \nvariables  were used : Return on A ssets, Return on E quity  and Net Asset Value  per share . In addition, \nseveral independent variables were taken into consideration including natural log arithmic value  of \nassets, total asset turnover, age, ratio of female board directors, ratio of independent decision -makers \non board , ratio of government -appointed  directors, ratio of overseas  directors, portion  of sponsor \nshareholding, and board attendance.  This report investigated the information of 54 DSE -listed \ncompanies from 2011 -2021 of Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals and Food & Allied industry in \nBangladesh.   \nChapter 4 discussed the core analysis and preliminary tests for the research. There was no \nmultico llinearity issue between the variables and but there  were heterscedascticity and serial \ncorrelation problem. The analysis revealed that the ratio of foreign directors on board  had no \nsignificance  with business  performance in any of the models examined. In contrast, the ratio of women  \non board  had a significant influence  with NAV but negatively . It was expected that the presence of \nfemale directors will bring positive and higher firm performance.  The results also showed that the ratio \nof independent directors on board  had a noteworthy  correlation with ROA, but  again  negatively . On \nthe other hand, the ratio of government decision makers  on board  had a substantial  connection  with \nROE, and the sign was correct, but it had the wrong sign w ith NAV. Moreover, the variables total asset \n68 \n turnover ratio  and natural logarithm ic value  of asset s were very close to each other. The analysis \nrevealed that total asset turnover ratio  had no substantial influence on business  growth , while natural \nlogarith mic value  of total asset  was significantly related to both ROE and NAV, with positive signs. \nThe age variable was insignificant in all models examined.  Sponsoring ownership , on the contrary , had \na noteworthy  relationship with both ROA and NAV, with positiv e signs. Lastly, the attendance in board \nmeetings  was significant in all models, with a 5% to 10% significance level. These findings have \nimportant implications for companies seeking to enhance their performance through board diversity. \nThe results reveal and recommend  that the arrangement  of the board in terms of gender, independence, \nnationality, and governance has varying controls  on business  performance in Pharmaceutical & \nChemical and Food & Allied industry in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the qualification s of independent \ndirectors have also been defined. Additionally, female directors should be appointed based on \nqualifications and professional skills, rather than family relations, in order to attract investors and \nimprove financial performance.  Additional ly, this report  highlights the significance of certain control \nvariables, such as sponsoring ownership  and the attendance in board meetings , in contributing to firm \nperformance. Companies in these industries can use these insights to develop strategies tha t leverage \nthe strengths of their board composition and control variables to improve their performance.   \n5.2 Conclusion  \nBoard diversity inputs its contribution to firms’ performance and profitability. There is no doubt that \nboard diversity is essential for  companies that want to thrive in today's context. In today’s world, \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion are increasingly important considerations for customers, employees, \nand other stakeholders. Despite the growing recognition of the importance of board diversity, there has \nbeen some debate about the extent to which it contributes to firm performance and profitability. While \nsome studies have found a positive relationship between board diversity and performance, others have \nfound no significant effect, or  even negative effects, particularly in certain industries or countries.  \nWhere it was expected that inclusion of female, independent, foreign directors bring positive impact \non company’s overall performance and government directors decreases compan y perfor mance,  the \nfindings of this report definitely discloses some different results. For example, female directors, in \nparticular, are believed to bring a unique perspective and experience that can help companies better \nunderstand and respond to the needs of fe male customers and employees. Independent directors can \nalso provide a more objective perspective on company decisions, while foreign directors can bring \nvaluable insights into new markets and cultural perspectives.  Government directors may be seen as a \npositive addition to the board in countries where the government plays a significant role in the \neconomy, but they may have a negative impact in countries where the government is seen as less \neffective or trustworthy.  Other studies have found that the impact  of board diversity on performance \nmay vary depending on the industry or country in question. However, this report suggests that the \ndiverse board brings more insignificant negative effects rather positive changes.  \nBoards of directors need to be able to n avigate complex and diverse issues and make decisions that \nreflect the needs and interests of a wide range of stakeholders. Board diversity definitely increases  \nglobalization, tackles social and environmental challenges, and brings technological disruption s, but if \nit brings more negative changes rather positive ones, it should be less prioritized. The corporate \ngovernance framework in Bangladesh is governed primarily by the Companies Act 1994, the Securities \n69 \n and Exchange Commission Act 1993, and the Securi ties and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules and \nRegulations. The government of Bangladesh has also issued a number of guidelines and codes of \nconduct to promote good corporate governance practices.  There is hope tha t the Corporate Governance \nCode 2018 can hel p to change this in the future . Corporate Governance Code 2018 is a set of guidelines \nand principles developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Bangladesh to promote \ngood corporate governance practices among listed companies in the countr y. This law specifies tha t \nthe number of board of directors at least  be between 5 and 20, and the independent directors must be \nat least 1/5th of the total number of directors.  Proper implementation of this law may improve the effect \nof autonomous  decision  makers on board  on business growth and success . The decision to include \ndiversity in the composition of a board of directors is a significant responsibility for the decision \nmakers of any organization. In Bangladesh, this decision is particularly importan t for industries such \nas Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals and Food & Allied, which operate very differently from other \nindustries in the country. Therefore, the process for appointing board members in these industries needs \nto be tailored to their unique charac teristics.  This report aims to contribute to those  specific sectors in \nBangladesh by examining how board diversity works in these industries. By presenting a clear view of \nthe impact of board diversity in these industries, decision makers in these sectors will be better \nequipped to make informed decisions regarding board composition.  In the Pharmaceuticals & \nChemicals industry, board diversity can bring a range of benefits, including a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of the market, improved risk management , and enhanced innovation. This industry is \nheavily regulated and requires a deep understanding of complex regulations and compliance \nrequirements. Similarly, in the Food & Allied industry, board diversity can help companies address the \nunique challenges f aced by this sector, including issues related to food safety, supply chain \nmanagement, and sustainability. Diverse board members can bring a range of skills and expertise, \nincluding knowledge of consumer trends, marketing, and logistics, which can help com panies stay \ncompetitive and adapt to changing market conditions.  Overall, while there may be some variations in \nthe impact of different types of diversities on company performance and profitability, the evidence \nsuggests that board diversity is an importan t factor for companies that want to thrive in today's context. \nBy embracing diversity and building more inclusive and effective boards, companies can unlock new \nopportunities for growth, innovation, and success in a rapidly changing business environment.  \nIn conclusion, board diversity is a crucial factor in now-a-days, where companies face a range of \ncomplex and diverse challenges. A diverse board can bring together a range of perspectives and \nexperiences, leading to better decision -making, greater innovati on, and improved performance. But it \ncan also bring slow decision -making, increase of expenses and increased disputes as well. To  navigate \nthe fast -changing business landscape, it is important to respond to the needs and interests of diverse \nstakeholders, and build a more sustainable and socially responsible future . The inclusion must be \naccording to the need of the specific company in the industry.  Moreover,  it must be declared that \ncompanies can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and success  in today's dynamic and \never-changing business environment  with diverse and effective board . \n \n70 \n References  \nA.
